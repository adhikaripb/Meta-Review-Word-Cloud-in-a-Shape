AB  - In this study, we investigated the intricate interplay between Trichoderma and the tomato genome, focusing on the transcriptional and metabolic changes triggered during the late colonization event. Microarray probe set (GSE76332) was utilized to analyze the gene expression profiles changes of the un-inoculated control (tomato) and Trichoderma-tomato interactions for identification of the differentially expressed significant genes. Based on principal component analysis and R-based correlation, we observed a positive correlation between the two cross-comaparable groups, corroborating the existence of transcriptional responses in the host triggered by Trichoderma priming. The statistically significant genes based on different p-value cut-off scores [(p(adj)-values or q-value); p(adj)-value < 0.05], [(p(cal)-values); p(cal)-value < 0.05; p(cal) < 0.01; p(cal) < 0.001)] were cross compared. Through cross-comparison, we identified 156 common genes that were consistently significant across all probability thresholds, and showing a strong positive corelation between p-value and q-value in the selected probe sets. We reported TD2, CPT1, pectin synthase, EXT-3 (extensin-3), Lox C, and pyruvate kinase (PK), which exhibited upregulated expression, and Glb1 and nitrate reductase (nii), which demonstrated downregulated expression during Trichoderma-tomato interaction. In addition, microbial priming with Trichoderma resulted into differential expression of transcription factors related to systemic defense and flowering including MYB13, MYB78, ERF2, ERF3, ERF5, ERF-1B, NAC, MADS box, ZF3, ZAT10, A20/AN1, polyol sugar transporter like zinc finger proteins, and a novel plant defensin protein. The potential bottleneck and hub genes involved in this dynamic response were also identified. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis based on 25 topmost DEG(S) (p(cal)-value < 0.05) and the Weighted Correlation Gene Network Analysis (WGCNA) of the 1786 significant DEGs (p(cal-)value < 0.05) we reported the hits associated with carbohydrate metabolism, secondary metabolite biosynthesis, and the nitrogen metabolism. We conclude that the Trichoderma-induced microbial priming re-programmed the host genome for transcriptional response during the late colonization event and were characterized by metabolic shifting and biochemical changes specific to plant growth and development. The work also highlights the relevance of statistical parameters in understanding the gene regulatory dynamics and complex regulatory networks based on differential expression, co-expression, and protein interaction networks orchestrating the host responses to beneficial microbial interactions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bolting refers to the early flowering stem production on agricultural and horticultural crops before harvesting. Indeed, bolting is an event induced by the coordinated effects of various environmental factors and endogenous genetic components, which cause a large reduction in the quality and productivity of vegetable crops like spinach. However, little is known about the signaling pathways and molecular functions involved in bolting mechanisms in spinach. The genetic information regarding the transition from vegetative growth to the reproductive stage in spinach would represent an advantage to regulate bolting time and improvement of resistant cultivars to minimize performance loss. RESULTS: To investigate the key genes and their genetic networks controlling spinach bolting, we performed RNA-seq analysis on early bolting accession Kashan and late-bolting accession Viroflay at both vegetative and reproductive stages and found a significant number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) ranging from 195 to 1230 in different comparisons. These genes were mainly associated with the signaling pathways of vernalization, photoperiod/circadian clock, gibberellin, autonomous, and aging pathways. Gene ontology analysis uncovered terms associated with carbohydrate metabolism, and detailed analysis of expression patterns for genes of Fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate aldolase, TREHALOSE-6-PHOSPHATE SYNTHASE 1, FLOWERING PROMOTING FACTOR 1, EARLY FLOWERING, GIGANTEA, and MADS-box proteins revealed their potential roles in the initiating or delaying of bolting. CONCLUSION: This study is the first report on identifying bolting and flowering-related genes based on transcriptome sequencing in spinach, which provides insight into bolting control and can be useful for molecular breeding programs and further study in the regulation of the genetic mechanisms related to bolting in other vegetable crops.

AB  - Interactions between MADS box transcription factors are critical in the regulation of floral development, and shifting MADS box protein-protein interactions are predicted to have influenced floral evolution. However, precisely how evolutionary variation in protein-protein interactions affects MADS box protein function remains unknown. To assess the impact of changing MADS box protein-protein interactions on transcription factor function, we turned to the grasses, where interactions between B-class MADS box proteins vary. We tested the functional consequences of this evolutionary variability using maize (Zea mays) as an experimental system. We found that differential B-class dimerization was associated with subtle, quantitative differences in stamen shape. In contrast, differential dimerization resulted in large-scale changes to downstream gene expression. Differential dimerization also affected B-class complex composition and abundance, independent of transcript levels. This indicates that differential B-class dimerization affects protein degradation, revealing an important consequence for evolutionary variability in MADS box interactions. Our results highlight complexity in the evolution of developmental gene networks: changing protein-protein interactions could affect not only the composition of transcription factor complexes but also their degradation and persistence in developing flowers. Our results also show how coding change in a pleiotropic master regulator could have small, quantitative effects on development.

AB  - Plant microRNAs (miRNAs) are small, regulatory non-coding RNAs involved in a wide range of biological processes, from organ development to response to stimuli. In recent years, an increasing number of studies on model plant species have highlighted the evolutionary conservation of a high number of miRNA families and the existence of taxon-specific ones. However, few studies have examined miRNAs in non-model species such as orchids, which are characterized by highly diversified floral structures and pollination strategies. Therefore, we analysed a small RNA library of inflorescence tissue of the Mediterranean orchid Orchis italica to increase the knowledge on miRNAs in a non-model plant species. The high-throughput sequencing and analysis of a small RNA library of inflorescence of O. italica revealed 23 conserved and 161 putative novel miRNA families. Among the putative miRNA targets, experimental validation demonstrated that a DEF-like MADS-box transcript is cleaved by the homolog of miR5179 of O. italica. The presence of conserved miRNA families in the inflorescence of O. italica indicates that the basic developmental flower regulatory mechanisms mediated by miRNAs are maintained through evolution. Because, according to the "orchid code" theory, DEF-like genes exert a key function in the diversification of tepals and lip, the cleavage-mediated inhibitory activity of miR5179 on a OitaDEF-like transcript suggests that, in orchids, miRNAs play an important role in the diversification of the perianth organs.

AB  - The diverse flowers of Orchidaceae are the result of several major morphological transitions, among them the most studied is the differentiation of the inner median tepal into the labellum, a perianth organ key in pollinator attraction. Type A peloria lacking stamens and with ectopic labella in place of inner lateral tepals are useful for testing models on the genes specifying these organs by comparing their patterns of expression between wild-type and peloric flowers. Previous studies focused on DEFICIENS- and GLOBOSA-like MADS-box genes because of their conserved role in perianth and stamen development. The "orchid code" model summarizes this work and shows in Orchidaceae there are four paralogous lineages of DEFICIENS/AP3-like genes differentially expressed in each floral whorl. Experimental tests of this model showed the conserved, higher expression of genes from two specific DEF-like gene lineages is associated with labellum development. The present study tests whether eight MADS-box candidate SEP-, FUL-, AG-, and STK-like genes have been specifically duplicated in the Orchidaceae and are also differentially expressed in association with the distinct flower organs of Phalaenopsis hyb. "Athens." The gene trees indicate orchid-specific duplications. In a way analogous to what is observed in labellum-specific DEF-like genes, a two-fold increase in the expression of SEP3-like gene PhaMADS7 was measured in the labellum-like inner lateral tepals of peloric flowers. The overlap between SEP3-like and DEF-like genes suggests both are associated with labellum specification and similar positional cues determine their domains of expression. In contrast, the uniform messenger levels of FUL-like genes suggest they are involved in the development of all organs and their expression in the ovary suggests cell differentiation starts before pollination. As previously reported AG-like and STK-like genes are exclusively expressed in gynostemium and ovary, however no evidence for transcriptional divergence was found in the stage investigated. Gene expression suggests a developmental regulatory system based on the combined activity of duplicate MADS-box genes. We discuss its feasibility based on documented protein interactions and patterns of expression.

AB  - The developmental roles of AGL15 and AGL18, members of the AGL15-like clade of MADS domain regulatory factors, have not been defined previously. Analysis of transgenic Arabidopsis plants showed that overexpression of AGL18 produces the same phenotypic changes as overexpression of AGL15, and the two genes have partially overlapping expression patterns. Functional redundancy was confirmed through analysis of loss-of-function mutants. agl15 agl18 double mutants, but not single mutants, flower early under non-inductive conditions, indicating that AGL15 and AGL18 act in a redundant fashion as repressors of the floral transition. Further genetic analyses and expression studies were used to examine the relationship between AGL15 and AGL18 activity and other regulators of the floral transition. AGL15 and AGL18 act upstream of the floral integrator FT, and a combination of agl15 and agl18 mutations partially suppresses defects in the photoperiod pathway. agl15 agl18 mutations show an additive relationship with mutations in genes encoding other MADS domain floral repressors, and further acceleration of flowering is seen in triple and quadruple mutants under both inductive and non-inductive conditions. Thus, flowering time is determined by the additive effect of multiple MADS domain floral repressors, with important contributions from AGL15 and AGL18.

AB  - Flower development is an important determinant of grain yield in crops. In wheat (Triticum spp.), natural variation for the size of spikelet and floral organs is particularly evident in Triticum turgidum ssp. polonicum (also termed Triticum polonicum), a tetraploid subspecies of wheat with long glumes, lemmas, and grains. Using map-based cloning, we identified VEGETATIVE TO REPRODUCTIVE TRANSITION 2 (VRT2), which encodes a MADS-box transcription factor belonging to the SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE family, as the gene underlying the T. polonicum long-glume (P1) locus. The causal P1 mutation is a sequence rearrangement in intron-1 that results in ectopic expression of the T. polonicum VRT-A2 allele. Based on allelic variation studies, we propose that the intron-1 mutation in VRT-A2 is the unique T. polonicum subspecies-defining polymorphism, which was later introduced into hexaploid wheat via natural hybridizations. Near-isogenic lines differing for the P1 locus revealed a gradient effect of P1 across spikelets and within florets. Transgenic lines of hexaploid wheat carrying the T. polonicum VRT-A2 allele show that expression levels of VRT-A2 are highly correlated with spike, glume, grain, and floral organ length. These results highlight how changes in expression profiles, through variation in cis-regulation, can affect agronomic traits in a dosage-dependent manner in polyploid crops.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Correct flower formation requires highly specific temporal and spatial regulation of gene expression. In Arabidopsis thaliana the majority of the master regulators that determine flower organ identity belong to the MADS-domain transcription factor family. The canonical DNA binding motif for this transcription factor family is the CArG-box, which has the consensus CC(A/T)(6)GG. However, so far, a comprehensive analysis of MADS-domain binding patterns has not yet been performed. RESULTS: Eight publicly available ChIP-seq datasets of MADS-domain proteins that regulate the floral transition and flower formation were analyzed. Surprisingly, the preferred DNA binding motif of each protein was a CArG-box with an NAA extension. Furthermore, motifs of other transcription factors were found in the vicinity of binding sites of MADS-domain transcription factors, suggesting that interaction of MADS-domain proteins with other transcription factors is important for target gene regulation. Finally, conservation of CArG-boxes between Arabidopsis ecotypes was assessed to obtain information about their evolutionary importance. CArG-boxes that fully matched the consensus were more conserved than other CArG-boxes, suggesting that the perfect CArG-box is evolutionary more important than other CArG-box variants. CONCLUSION: Our analysis provides detailed insight into MADS-domain protein binding patterns. The results underline the importance of an extended version of the CArG-box and provide a first view on evolutionary conservation of MADS-domain protein binding sites in Arabidopsis ecotypes.

AB  - Variations in magnetic field (MF) intensity are known to induce plant morphological and gene expression changes. In Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0, near-null magnetic field (NNMF, i.e., <100 nT MF) causes a delay in the transition to flowering, but the expression of genes involved in this response has been poorly studied. Here, we showed a time-course quantitative analysis of the expression of both leaf (including clock genes, photoperiod pathway, GA20ox, SVP, and vernalization pathway) and floral meristem (including GA2ox, SOC1, AGL24, LFY, AP1, FD, and FLC) genes involved in the transition to flowering in A. thaliana under NNMF. NNMF induced a delayed flowering time and a significant reduction of leaf area index and flowering stem length, with respect to controls under geomagnetic field. Generation experiments (F(1) - and F(2) -NNMF) showed retention of flowering delay. The quantitative expression (qPCR) of some A. thaliana genes expressed in leaves and floral meristem was studied during transition to flowering. In leaves and flowering meristem, NNMF caused an early downregulation of clock, photoperiod, gibberellin, and vernalization pathways and a later downregulation of TSF, AP1, and FLC. In the floral meristem, the downregulation of AP1, AGL24, FT, and FLC in early phases of floral development was accompanied by a downregulation of the gibberellin pathway. The progressive upregulation of AGL24 and AP1 was also correlated to the delayed flowering by NNMF. The flowering delay is associated with the strong downregulation of FT, FLC, and GA20ox in the floral meristem and FT, TSF, FLC, and GA20ox in leaves. Bioelectromagnetics. 39:361-374, 2018.

AB  - Flowering in orchids is the most important horticultural trait regulated by multiple mechanisms. Arundina graminifolia flowers throughout the year unlike other orchids with a narrow flowering span. However, little is known of the genetic regulation of this peculiar flowering pattern. This study identifies a number of transcription factor (TF) families in five stages of flower development and four tissue types through RNA-seq transcriptome. About 700 DEGs were annotated to the transcription factor category and classified into 35 TF families, which were involved in multiple signaling pathways. The most abundant TF family was bHLH, followed by MYB and WRKY. Some important members of the bHLH, WRKY, MYB, TCP, and MADS-box families were found to regulate the flowering genes at transcriptional levels. Particularly, the TFs WRKY34 and ERF12 possibly respond to vernalization and photoperiod signaling, MYB108, RR9, VP1, and bHLH49 regulate hormonal balance, and CCA1 may control the circadian pathway. MADS-box TFs including MADS6, 14, 16, AGL5, and SEP may be important regulators of flowering in A. graminifolia. Therefore, this study provides a theoretical basis for understanding the molecular mechanism of flowering in A. graminifolia.

AB  - Flowering is the most studied ornamental trait in orchids where long vegetative phase may span up to three years. Cymbidium orchids produce beautiful flowers with astonishing shapes and pleasant scent. However, an unusually long vegetative phase is a major drawback to their ornamental value. We observed that under certain culture conditions, three cymbidium species (Cymbidium ensifolium, C. goeringii and C. sinense) skipped vegetative growth phase and directly flowered within six months, that could be a breakthrough for future orchids with limited vegetative growth. Hormonal and floral regulators could be the key factors arresting vegetative phase. Therefore, transcriptomic analyses were performed for leafless flowers and normal vegetative leaves to ascertain differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to hormones (auxin, cytokinin, gibberellin, abscisic acid and ethylene), floral integrators and MADS-box genes. A significant difference of cytokinin and floral regulators was observed among three species as compared to other hormones. The MADS-box genes were significantly expressed in the leafless flowers of C. sinense as compared to other species. Among the key floral regulators, CONSTANS and AGAMOUS-like genes showed the most differential expression in the leafless flowers as compared to leaves where the expression was negligible. However, CONSTANS also showed downregulation. Auxin efflux carriers were mainly downregulated in the leafless flowers of C. ensifolium and C. sinense, while they were upregulated in C. goeringii. Moreover, gibberellin and cytokinin genes were also downregulated in C. ensifolium and C. sinense flowers, while they were upregulated in C. goeringii, suggesting that species may vary in their responses. The data mining thus, outsources the valuable information to direct future research on orchids at industrial levels.

AB  - The marvelously diverse Orchidaceae constitutes the largest family of angiosperms. The genus Cymbidium in Orchidaceae is well known for its unique vegetation, floral morphology, and flower scent traits. Here, a chromosome-scale assembly of the genome of Cymbidium ensifolium (Jianlan) is presented. Comparative genomic analysis showed that C. ensifolium has experienced two whole-genome duplication (WGD) events, the most recent of which was shared by all orchids, while the older event was the tau event shared by most monocots. The results of MADS-box genes analysis provided support for establishing a unique gene model of orchid flower development regulation, and flower shape mutations in C. ensifolium were shown to be associated with the abnormal expression of MADS-box genes. The most abundant floral scent components identified included methyl jasmonate, acacia alcohol and linalool, and the genes involved in the floral scent component network of C. ensifolium were determined. Furthermore, the decreased expression of photosynthesis-antennae and photosynthesis metabolic pathway genes in leaves was shown to result in colorful striped leaves, while the increased expression of MADS-box genes in leaves led to perianth-like leaves. Our results provide fundamental insights into orchid evolution and diversification.

AB  - Since the first MADS-box transcription factor genes were implicated in the establishment of floral organ identity in a couple of model plants, the size and scope of this gene family has begun to be appreciated in a much wider range of species. Over the course of millions of years the number of MADS-box genes in plants has increased to the point that the Arabidopsis genome contains more than 100. The understanding gained from studying the evolution, regulation and function of multiple MADS-box genes in an increasing set of species, makes this large plant transcription factor gene family an ideal subject to study the processes that lead to an increase in gene number and the selective birth, death and repurposing of its component members. Here we will use examples taken from the MADS-box gene family to review what is known about the factors that influence the loss and retention of genes duplicated in different ways and examine the varied fates of the retained genes and their associated biological outcomes.

AB  - Plants enter their reproductive phase when the environmental conditions are favourable for the successful production of progeny. The transition from vegetative to reproductive phase is influenced by several environmental factors including ambient temperature. In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) is critical for this pathway; svp mutants cannot modify their flowering time in response to ambient temperature. SVP encodes a MADS-box transcription factor that directly represses genes that promote flowering. SVP binds DNA in complexes with other MADS-box transcription factors, including FLOWERING LOCUS M (FLM), which acts with SVP to repress the floral transition at low temperatures. Small temperature changes post-transcriptionally regulate FLM through temperature-dependent alternative splicing (TD-AS). As ambient temperature increases, the predominant FLM splice isoform shifts to encode a protein incapable of exerting a repressive effect on flowering. Here we characterize a closely related MADS-box transcription factor, MADS AFFECTING FLOWERING2 (MAF2), which has independently evolved TD-AS. At low temperatures the most abundant MAF2 splice variant encodes a protein that interacts with SVP to repress flowering. At increased temperature the relative abundance of splice isoforms shifts in favour of an intron-retaining variant that introduces a premature termination codon. We show that this isoform encodes a protein that cannot interact with SVP or repress flowering. At lower temperatures MAF2 and SVP repress flowering in parallel with FLM and SVP, providing an additional input to sense ambient temperature for the control of flowering.

AB  - Recent efforts to sequence the genomes and transcriptomes of several gymnosperm species have revealed an increased complexity in certain gene families in gymnosperms as compared to angiosperms. One example of this is the gymnosperm sister clade to angiosperm TM3-like MADS-box genes, which at least in the conifer lineage has expanded in number of genes. We have previously identified a member of this sub-clade, the conifer gene DEFICIENS AGAMOUS LIKE 19 (DAL19), as being specifically upregulated in cone-setting shoots. Here, we show through Sanger sequencing of mRNA-derived cDNA and mapping to assembled conifer genomic sequences that DAL19 produces six mature mRNA splice variants in Picea abies. These splice variants use alternate first and last exons, while their four central exons constitute a core region present in all six transcripts. Thus, they are likely to be transcript isoforms. Quantitative Real-Time PCR revealed that two mutually exclusive first DAL19 exons are differentially expressed across meristems that will form either male or female cones, or vegetative shoots. Furthermore, mRNA in situ hybridization revealed that two mutually exclusive last DAL19 exons were expressed in a cell-specific pattern within bud meristems. Based on these findings in DAL19, we developed a sensitive approach to transcript isoform assembly from short-read sequencing of mRNA. We applied this method to 42 putative MADS-box core regions in P. abies, from which we assembled 1084 putative transcripts. We manually curated these transcripts to arrive at 933 assembled transcript isoforms of 38 putative MADS-box genes. 152 of these isoforms, which we assign to 28 putative MADS-box genes, were differentially expressed across eight female, male, and vegetative buds. We further provide evidence of the expression of 16 out of the 38 putative MADS-box genes by mapping PacBio Iso-Seq circular consensus reads derived from pooled sample sequencing to assembled transcripts. In summary, our analyses reveal the use of mutually exclusive exons of MADS-box gene isoforms during early bud development in P. abies, and we find that the large number of identified MADS-box transcripts in P. abies results not only from expansion of the gene family through gene duplication events but also from the generation of numerous splice variants.

AB  - Vernalization is the promotion of the competence for flowering by long periods of low temperatures such as those typically experienced during winters. In Arabidopsis, the vernalization response is, to a large extent, mediated by the repression of the floral repressor FLC, and the stable epigenetic silencing of FLC after cold treatments is essential for vernalization. In addition to FLC, other vernalization targets exist in Arabidopsis. In grasses, vernalization seems to be entirely independent of FLC. Here, the current understanding of FLC-independent branches of the vernalization pathway in Arabidopsis and vernalization without FLC in grasses is discussed. This review focuses on the role of AGL19, AGL24, and the MAF genes in Arabidopsis. Interestingly, vernalization acts through related molecular machineries on distinct targets. In particular, protein complexes similar to Drosophila Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 play a prominent role in establishing an epigenetic cellular memory for cold-regulated expression states of AGL19 and FLC. Finally, the similar network topology of the apparently independently evolved vernalization pathways of grasses and Arabidopsis is discussed.

AB  - Improving grain yield potential in rice is an important step toward addressing global food security challenges. The meta-QTL analysis offers stable and robust QTLs irrespective of the genetic background of mapping populations and phenotype environment and effectively narrows confidence intervals (CI) for candidate gene (CG) mining and marker-assisted selection improvement. To achieve these aims, a comprehensive bibliographic search for grain yield traits (spikelet fertility, number of grains per panicle, panicles number per plant, and 1000-grain weight) QTLs was conducted, and 462 QTLs were retrieved from 47 independent QTL research published between 2002 and 2022. QTL projection was performed using a reference map with a cumulative length of 2,945.67 cM, and MQTL analysis was conducted on 313 QTLs. Consequently, a total of 62 MQTLs were identified with reduced mean CI (up to 3.40 fold) compared to the mean CI of original QTLs. However, 10 of these MQTLs harbored at least six of the initial QTLs from diverse genetic backgrounds and environments and were considered the most stable and robust MQTLs. Also, MQTLs were compared with GWAS studies and resulted in the identification of 16 common significant loci modulating the evaluated traits. Gene annotation, gene ontology (GO) enrichment, and RNA-seq analyses of chromosome regions of the stable MQTLs detected 52 potential CGs including those that have been cloned in previous studies. These genes encode proteins known to be involved in regulating grain yield including cytochrome P450, zinc fingers, MADs-box, AP2/ERF domain, F-box, ubiquitin ligase domain protein, homeobox domain, DEAD-box ATP domain, and U-box domain. This study provides the framework for molecular dissection of grain yield in rice. Moreover, the MQTLs and CGs identified could be useful for fine mapping, gene cloning, and marker-assisted selection to improve rice productivity.

AB  - Barley yellow dwarf viruses (BYDVs) are one of the most widespread and economically important plant viruses affecting many cereal crops. Growing resistant varieties remains the most promising approach to reduce the impact of BYDVs. A Recent RNA sequencing analysis has revealed potential genes that respond to BYDV infection in resistant barley genotypes. Together with a comprehensive review of the current knowledge on disease resistance in plants, we selected nine putative barley and wheat genes to investigate their involvement in resistance to BYDV-PAV infection. The target classes of genes were (i) nucleotide binding site (NBS) leucine-rich repeat (LRR), (ii) coiled-coil nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (CC-NB-LRR), (iii) LRR receptor-like kinase (RLK), (iv) casein kinase, (v) protein kinase, (vi) protein phosphatase subunits and the transcription factors (TF) (vii) MYB TF, (viii) GRAS (gibberellic acid-insensitive (GAI), repressor of GAI (RGA) and scarecrow (SCR)), and (ix) the MADS-box TF family. Expression of genes was analysed for six genotypes with different levels of resistance. As in previous reports, the highest BYDV-PAV titre was found in the susceptible genotypes Graciosa in barley and Semper and SGS 27-02 in wheat, which contrast with the resistant genotypes PRS-3628 and Wysor of wheat and barley, respectively. Statistically significant changes in wheat show up-regulation of NBS-LRR, CC-NBS-LRR and RLK in the susceptible genotypes and down-regulation in the resistant genotypes in response to BYDV-PAV. Similar up-regulation of NBS-LRR, CC-NBS-LRR, RLK and MYB TF in response to BYDV-PAV was also observed in the susceptible barley genotypes. However, no significant changes in the expression of these genes were generally observed in the resistant barley genotypes, except for the down-regulation of RLK. Casein kinase and Protein phosphatase were up-regulated early, 10 days after inoculation (dai) in the susceptible wheat genotypes, while the latter was down-regulated at 30 dai in resistant genotypes. Protein kinase was down-regulated both earlier (10 dai) and later (30 dai) in the susceptible wheat genotypes, but only in the later dai in the resistant genotypes. In contrast, GRAS TF and MYB TF were up-regulated in the susceptible wheat genotypes while no significant differences in MADS TF expression was observed. Protein kinase, Casein kinase (30 dai), MYB TF and GRAS TF (10 dai) were all up-regulated in the susceptible barley genotypes. However, no significant differences were found between the resistant and susceptible barley genotypes for the Protein phosphatase and MADS FT genes. Overall, our results showed a clear differentiation of gene expression patterns in both resistant and susceptible genotypes of wheat and barley. Therefore, further research on RLK, NBS-LRR, CC-NBS-LRR, GRAS TF and MYB TF can lead to BYDV-PAV resistance in cereals.

AB  - Plant growth is largely post-embryonic and depends on meristems that are active throughout the lifespan of an individual. Developmental patterns rely on the coordinated spatio-temporal expression of different genes, and the activity of transcription factors is particularly important during most morphogenetic processes. MADS-box genes constitute a transcription factor family in eukaryotes. In Arabidopsis, their proteins participate in all major aspects of shoot development, but their role in root development is still not well characterized. In this review we synthetize current knowledge pertaining to the function of MADS-box genes highly expressed in roots: XAL1, XAL2, ANR1 and AGL21, as well as available data for other MADS-box genes expressed in this organ. The role of Trithorax group and Polycomb group complexes on MADS-box genes' epigenetic regulation is also discussed. We argue that understanding the role of MADS-box genes in root development of species with contrasting architectures is still a challenge. Finally, we propose that MADS-box genes are key components of the gene regulatory networks that underlie various gene expression patterns, each one associated with the distinct developmental fates observed in the root. In the case of XAL1 and XAL2, their role within these networks could be mediated by regulatory feedbacks with auxin.

AB  - Changes in genes encoding transcriptional regulators can alter development and are important components of the molecular mechanisms of morphological evolution. MADS-box genes encode transcriptional regulators of diverse and important biological functions. In plants, MADS-box genes regulate flower, fruit, leaf, and root development. Recent sequencing efforts in Arabidopsis have allowed a nearly complete sampling of the MADS-box gene family from a single plant, something that was lacking in previous phylogenetic studies. To test the long-suspected parallel between the evolution of the MADS-box gene family and the evolution of plant form, a polarized gene phylogeny is necessary. Here we suggest that a gene duplication ancestral to the divergence of plants and animals gave rise to two main lineages of MADS-box genes: TypeI and TypeII. We locate the root of the eukaryotic MADS-box gene family between these two lineages. A novel monophyletic group of plant MADS domains (AGL34 like) seems to be more closely related to previously identified animal SRF-like MADS domains to form TypeI lineage. Most other plant sequences form a clear monophyletic group with animal MEF2-like domains to form TypeII lineage. Only plant TypeII members have a K domain that is downstream of the MADS domain in most plant members previously identified. This suggests that the K domain evolved after the duplication that gave rise to the two lineages. Finally, a group of intermediate plant sequences could be the result of recombination events. These analyses may guide the search for MADS-box sequences in basal eukaryotes and the phylogenetic placement of new genes from other plant species.

AB  - MADS-box genes encode transcriptional regulators involved in diverse aspects of plant development. Here we describe the cloning and mRNA spatio-temporal expression patterns of five new MADS-box genes from Arabidopsis: AGL16, AGL18, AGL19, AGL27 and AGL31. These genes will probably become important molecular tools for both evolutionary and functional analyses of vegetative structures. We mapped our data and previous expression patterns onto a new MADS-box phylogeny. These analyses suggest that the evolution of the MADS-box family has involved a rapid and simultaneous functional diversification in vegetative as well as reproductive structures. The hypothetical ancestral genes had broader expression patterns than more derived ones, which have been co-opted for putative specialized functions as suggested by their expression patterns. AGL27 and AGL31, which are closely related to the recently described flowering-time gene FLC (previously AGL25), are expressed in most plant tissues. AGL19 is specifically expressed in the outer layers of the root meristem (lateral root cap and epidermis) and in the central cylinder cells of mature roots. AGL18, which is most similar in sequence to the embryo-expressed AGL15 gene, is expressed in the endosperm and in developing male and female gametophytes, suggesting a role for AGL18 that is distinct from previously characterized MADS-box genes. Finally, AGL16 RNA accumulates in leaf guard cells and trichomes. Our new phylogeny reveals seven new monophyletic clades of MADS-box sequences not specific to flowers, suggesting that complex regulatory networks involving several MADS-box genes, similar to those that control flower development, underlie development of vegetative structures.

AB  - The MADS-box genes constitute a large transcription factor family that appear to have evolved by duplication and diversification of function. Two types of MADS-box genes are distinguished throughout eukaryotes, types I and II. Type II classic MADS-box genes, also known as MIKC-type, are key developmental regulators in flowering plants and are particularly well-studied for their role in floral organ specification. However, very little is known about the role that these genes might play outside of the flowering plants. We investigated the evolution of type II classic MADS-box genes across land plants by performing a maximum likelihood analysis with a particular focus on lycophytes. Here, we present the expression patterns of all three type II classic MADS-box homologs throughout plant development in the lycophyte Selaginella moellendorffii: SmMADS1, SmMADS3, and SmMADS6. We used scanning electron microscopy and histological analyses to define stages of sporangia development in S. moellendorffii. We performed phylogenetic analyses of this gene lineage across land plants and found that lycophyte sequences appeared before the multiple duplication events that gave rise to the major MADS-box gene lineages in seed plants. Our expression analyses by in situ hybridization show that all type II classic MADS-box genes in S. moellendorffii have broad but distinct patterns of expression in vegetative and reproductive tissues, where SmMADS1 and SmMADS6 only differ during late sporangia development. The broad expression during S. moellendorffii development suggests that MADS-box genes have undergone neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization after duplication events in seed plants.

AB  - The Arabidopsis FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) gene encodes a MADS box protein that acts as a dose-dependent repressor of flowering. Mutants and ecotypes with elevated expression of FLC are late flowering and vernalization responsive. In this study we describe an early flowering mutant in the C24 ecotype, flc expressor (flx), that has reduced expression of FLC. FLX encodes a protein of unknown function with putative leucine zipper domains. FLX is required for FRIGIDA (FRI)-mediated activation of FLC but not for activation of FLC in autonomous pathway mutants. FLX is also required for expression of the FLC paralogs MADS AFFECTING FLOWERING 1 (MAF1) and MAF2.

AB  - SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) is an important regulator of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) in the thermosensory pathway of Arabidopsis. It is a negative regulator of flowering and represses FT transcription. In poplar trees, FT2 is central for the photoperiodic control of growth cessation, which also requires the decrease of bioactive gibberellins (GAs). In angiosperm trees, genes similar to SVP, sometimes named DORMANCY-ASSOCIATED MADS-BOX genes, control temperature-mediated bud dormancy. Here we show that SVL, an SVP ortholog in aspen trees, besides its role in controlling dormancy through its expression in buds, is also contributing to the regulation of short day induced growth cessation and bud set through its expression in leaves. SVL is upregulated during short days in leaves and binds to the FT2 promoter to repress its transcription. It furthermore decreases the amount of active GAs, whose downregulation is essential for growth cessation, by repressing the transcription of GA20 oxidase. Finally, the SVL protein is more stable in colder temperatures, thus integrating the temperature signal into the response. We conclude that the molecular function of SVL in the photoperiodic pathway has been conserved between Arabidopsis and poplar trees, albeit the physiological process it controls has changed. SVL is thus both involved in regulating the photoperiod response in leaves, modulating the timing of growth cessation and bud set, and in the subsequent temperature regulation of dormancy in the buds.

AB  - We isolated and characterized two ovule-specific MADS box cDNAs from petunia, designated floral binding protein (fbp) genes 7 and 11. The putative protein products of these genes have approximately 90% of their overall amino acid sequence in common. In situ RNA hybridization experiments revealed that both genes are expressed in the center of the developing gynoecium before ovule primordia are visible. At later developmental stages, hybridization signals were observed only in the ovules, suggesting that these genes are involved in ovule formation. To test this hypothesis, we raised transgenic petunia plants in which both fbp7 and fbp11 expression was inhibited by cosuppression. In the ovary of these transformants, spaghetti-shaped structures developed in positions normally occupied by ovules. These abnormal structures morphologically and functionally resemble style and stigma tissues. Our results show that these MADS box genes belong to a new class of MADS box genes involved in proper ovule development in petunia.

AB  - Phytoplasmas are intracellular bacterial plant pathogens that cause devastating diseases in crops and ornamental plants by the secretion of effector proteins. One of these effector proteins, termed SECRETED ASTER YELLOWS WITCHES' BROOM PROTEIN 54 (SAP54), leads to the degradation of a specific subset of floral homeotic proteins of the MIKC-type MADS-domain family via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. In consequence, the developing flowers show the homeotic transformation of floral organs into vegetative leaf-like structures. The molecular mechanism of SAP54 action involves binding to the keratin-like domain of MIKC-type proteins and to some RAD23 proteins, which translocate ubiquitylated substrates to the proteasome. The structural requirements and specificity of SAP54 function are poorly understood, however. Here, we report, based on biophysical and molecular biological analyses, that SAP54 folds into an alpha-helical structure. Insertion of helix-breaking mutations disrupts correct folding of SAP54 and compromises SAP54 binding to its target proteins and, concomitantly, its ability to evoke disease phenotypes in vivo. Interestingly, dynamic light scattering data together with electrophoretic mobility shift assays suggest that SAP54 preferentially binds to multimeric complexes of MIKC-type proteins rather than to dimers or monomers of these proteins. Together with data from literature, this finding suggests that MIKC-type proteins and SAP54 constitute multimeric alpha-helical coiled coils. Our investigations clarify the structure-function relationship of an important phytoplasma effector protein and may thus ultimately help to develop treatments against some devastating plant diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Reliable indicators for the onset of flowering are not available for most perennial monocarpic species, representing a drawback for crops such as bamboo, agave and banana. The ability to predict and control the transition to the reproductive stage in A. tequilana would represent an advantage for field management of agaves for tequila production and for the development of a laboratory model for agave species. RESULTS: Consistent morphological features could not be determined for the vegetative to reproductive transition in A. tequilana. However, changes in carbohydrate metabolism where sucrose decreased and fructans of higher degree of polymerization increased in leaves before and after the vegetative to reproductive transition were observed. At the molecular level, transcriptome analysis from leaf and shoot apical meristem tissue of A. tequilana plants from different developmental stages identified OASES as the most effective assembly program and revealed evidence for incomplete transcript processing in the highly redundant assembly obtained. Gene ontology analysis uncovered enrichment for terms associated with carbohydrate and hormone metabolism and detailed analysis of expression patterns for individual genes revealed roles for specific Flowering locus T (florigen), MADS box proteins, gibberellins and fructans in the transition to flowering. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the data obtained, a preliminary model was developed to describe the regulatory mechanisms underlying the initiation of flowering in A. tequilana. Identification of specific promoter and repressor Flowering Locus T and MADS box genes facilitates functional analysis and the development of strategies to modulate the vegetative to reproductive transition in A. tequilana.

AB  - Pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum L.) is a vital staple food and an important cereal crop used as food, feed, and forage. It can withstand heat and drought due to the presence of some unique genes; however, the mechanism of salt stress has been missing in pearl millet until now. Therefore, we conducted a comparative transcriptome profiling to reveal the differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) associated with salt stress in pearl millet at different time points, such as 1, 3, and 7 h, of salt treatment. The physiological results suggested that salt stress significantly increased proline, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) in pearl millet at 1, 3, and 7 h of salt treatment. In addition, pearl millet plants regulated the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and peroxidase to lessen the impact of salinity. The transcriptomic results depicted that salt stress upregulated and downregulated the expression of various transcripts involved in different metabolic functions. At 1 and 7 h of salt treatment, most of the transcripts were highly upregulated as compared to the 3 h treatment. Moreover, among commonly enriched Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway and peroxisome pathway were significantly enriched. The DETs related to hormone signaling (auxins, ethylene, gibberellin, and abscisic acid), kinases, protein modifications, and degradation were also identified, depicting the possible role of hormones and kinases to enhance plant tolerance against salt stress. Furthermore, the transcription factors, such as ethylene-responsive element binding factors (ERF), basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH), HMG box-containing protein (HBP), MADS, myeloblastosis (MYB), and WRKY, were predicted to significantly regulate different transcripts involved in salt stress responses at three different time points. Overall, this study will provide new insights to better understand the salt stress regulation mechanisms in pearl millet to improve its resistance against salinity and to identify new transcripts that control these mechanisms in other cereals.

AB  - Plants MADS-domain/AGL proteins constitute a large transcription factor (TF) family that controls the development of almost every plant organ. We performed a phylogeny of (ca. 500) MADS-domain proteins from Arabidopsis and four legume species. We identified clades with Arabidopsis MADS-domain proteins known to participate in root development that grouped legume MADS-proteins with similar high expression in roots and nodules. In this work, we analyzed the role of AGL transcription factors in the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) - Rhizobium etli N-fixing symbiosis. Sixteen P. vulgaris AGL genes (PvAGL), out of 93 family members, are expressed - at different levels - in roots and nodules. From there, we selected the PvAGL gene denominated PvFUL-like for overexpression or silencing in composite plants, with transgenic roots and nodules, that were used for phenotypic analysis upon inoculation with Rhizobium etli. Because of sequence identity in the DNA sequence used for RNAi-FUL-like construct, roots, and nodules expressing this construct -referred to as RNAi_AGL- showed lower expression of other five PvAGL genes highly expressed in roots/nodules. Contrasting with PvFUL-like overexpressing plants, rhizobia-inoculated plants expressing the RNAi_AGL silencing construct presented affection in the generation and growth of transgenic roots from composite plants, both under non-inoculated or rhizobia-inoculated condition. Furthermore, the rhizobia-inoculated plants showed decreased rhizobial infection concomitant with the lower expression level of early symbiotic genes and increased number of small, ineffective nodules that indicate an alteration in the autoregulation of the nodulation symbiotic process. We propose that the positive effects of PvAGL TF in the rhizobia symbiotic processes result from its potential interplay with NIN, the master symbiotic TF regulator, that showed a CArG-box consensus DNA sequence recognized for DNA binding of AGL TF and presented an increased or decreased expression level in roots from non-inoculated plants transformed with OE_FUL or RNAi_AGL construct, respectively. Our work contributes to defining novel transcriptional regulators for the common bean - rhizobia N-fixing symbiosis, a relevant process for sustainable agriculture.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Wheat is a staple food crop for over one-third of the global population. However, the stability of wheat productivity is threatened by heat waves associated with climate change. Heat stress at the reproductive stage can result in pollen sterility and failure of grain development. METHODS: This study used transcriptome data analysis to explore the specific expression of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in response to heat stress during pollen development in four wheat cultivars. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We identified 11,054 lncRNA-producing loci, of which 5,482 lncRNAs showed differential expression in response to heat stress. Heat-responsive lncRNAs could target protein-coding genes in cis and trans and in lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks. Gene ontology analysis predicted that target protein-coding genes of lncRNAs regulate various biological processes such as hormonal responses, protein modification and folding, response to stress, and biosynthetic and metabolic processes. We also noted some paired lncRNA/protein-coding gene modules and some lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory modules shared in two or more wheat cultivars. These modules were related to regulating plant responses to heat stress, such as heat-shock proteins and transcription factors, and protein domains, such as MADS-box, Myc-type, and Alpha crystallin/Hsp20 domain. CONCLUSION: Our results provide the basic knowledge and molecular resources for future functional studies investigating wheat reproductive development under heat stress.

AB  - Spikelets are the fundamental building blocks of Poaceae inflorescences, and their development and branching patterns determine the various inflorescence architectures and grain yield of grasses. In wheat (Triticum aestivum), the central spikelets produce the most and largest grains, while spikelet size gradually decreases acropetally and basipetally, giving rise to the characteristic lanceolate shape of wheat spikes. The acropetal gradient corresponds with the developmental age of spikelets; however, the basal spikelets are developed first, and the cause of their small size and rudimentary development is unclear. Here, we adapted G&T-seq, a low-input transcriptomics approach, to characterize gene expression profiles within spatial sections of individual spikes before and after the establishment of the lanceolate shape. We observed larger differences in gene expression profiles between the apical, central, and basal sections of a single spike than between any section belonging to consecutive developmental time points. We found that SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE MADS-box transcription factors, including VEGETATIVE TO REPRODUCTIVE TRANSITION 2 (VRT-A2), are expressed highest in the basal section of the wheat spike and display the opposite expression gradient to flowering E-class SEPALLATA1 genes. Based on multi-year field trials and transgenic lines, we show that higher expression of VRT-A2 in the basal sections of the spike is associated with increased numbers of rudimentary basal spikelets. Our results, supported by computational modeling, suggest that the delayed transition of basal spikelets from vegetative to floral developmental programs results in the lanceolate shape of wheat spikes. This study highlights the value of spatially resolved transcriptomics to gain insights into developmental genetics pathways of grass inflorescences.

AB  - Dioecious plants possess diverse sex determination systems and unique mechanisms of reproductive organ development; however, little is known about how sex-linked genes shape the expression of regulatory cascades that lead to developmental differences between sexes. In Silene latifolia, a dioecious plant with stable dimorphism in floral traits, early experiments suggested that female-regulator genes act on the factors that determine the boundaries of the flower whorls. To identify these regulators, we sequenced the transcriptome of male flowers with fully developed gynoecia, induced by rapid demethylation in the parental generation. Eight candidates were found to have a positive role in gynoecium promotion, floral organ size, and whorl boundary, and affect the expression of class B MADS-box flower genes. To complement our transcriptome analysis, we closely examined the floral organs in their native state using field emission environmental scanning electron microscopy, and examined the differences between females and androhermaphrodites in their placenta and ovule organization. Our results reveal the regulatory pathways potentially involved in sex-specific flower development in the classical model of dioecy, S. latifolia. These pathways include previously hypothesized and unknown female-regulator genes that act on the factors that determine the flower boundaries, and a negative regulator of anther development, SUPERMAN-like (SlSUP).

AB  - In purple carrots, anthocyanin pigmentation can be expressed in the entire root, or it can display tissue specific-patterns. Within the phloem, purple pigmentation can be found in the outer phloem (OP) (also called the cortex) and inner phloem (IP), or it can be confined exclusively to the OP. In this work, the genetic control underlying tissue-specific anthocyanin pigmentation in the carrot root OP and IP tissues was investigated by means of linkage mapping and transcriptome (RNA-seq) and phylogenetic analyses; followed by gene expression (RT-qPCR) evaluations in two genetic backgrounds, an F(2) population (3242) and the inbred B7262. Genetic mapping of 'root outer phloem anthocyanin pigmentation' (ROPAP) and inner phloem pigmentation (RIPAP) revealed colocalization of ROPAP with the P(1) and P(3) genomic regions previously known to condition pigmentation in different genetic stocks, whereas RIPAP co-localized with P(3) only. Transcriptome analysis of purple OP (POP) vs. non-purple IP (NPIP) tissues, along with linkage and phylogenetic data, allowed an initial identification of 28 candidate genes, 19 of which were further evaluated by RT-qPCR in independent root samples of 3242 and B7262, revealing 15 genes consistently upregulated in the POP in both genetic backgrounds, and two genes upregulated in the POP in specific backgrounds. These include seven transcription factors, seven anthocyanin structural genes, and two genes involved in cellular transport. Altogether, our results point at DcMYB7, DcMYB113, and a MADS-box (DCAR_010757) as the main candidate genes conditioning ROPAP in 3242, whereas DcMYB7 and MADS-box condition RIPAP in this background. In 7262, DcMYB113 conditions ROPAP.

AB  - The Royal Irises (section Oncocyclus) are a Middle-Eastern group of irises, characterized by extremely large flowers with a huge range of flower colors and a unique pollination system. The Royal Irises are considered to be in the course of speciation and serve as a model for evolutionary processes of speciation and pollination ecology. However, no transcriptomic and genomic data are available for these plants. Transcriptome sequencing is a valuable resource for determining the genetic basis of ecological-meaningful traits, especially in non-model organisms. Here we describe the de novo transcriptome assembly of Iris atropurpurea, an endangered species endemic to Israel's coastal plain. We sequenced and analyzed the transcriptomes of roots, leaves, and three stages of developing flower buds. To identify genes involved in developmental processes we generated phylogenetic gene trees for two major gene families, the MADS-box and MYB transcription factors, which play an important role in plant development. In addition, we identified 1503 short sequence repeats that can be developed for molecular markers for population genetics in irises. This first reported transcriptome for the Royal Irises, and the data generated, provide a valuable resource for this non-model plant that will facilitate gene discovery, functional genomic studies, and development of molecular markers in irises, to complete the intensive eco-evolutionary studies of this group.

AB  - Cannabis (Cannabis sativa L.) is an influential yet controversial agricultural plant with a very long and prominent history of recreational, medicinal, and industrial usages. Given the importance of this species, we deepened some of the main challenges-along with potential solutions-behind the breeding of new cannabis cultivars. One of the main issues that should be fixed before starting new breeding programs is the uncertain taxonomic classification of the two main taxa (e.g., indica and sativa) of the Cannabis genus. We tried therefore to examine this topic from a molecular perspective through the use of DNA barcoding. Our findings seem to support a unique species system (C. sativa) based on two subspecies: C. sativa subsp. sativa and C. sativa subsp. indica. The second key issue in a breeding program is related to the dioecy behavior of this species and to the comprehension of those molecular mechanisms underlying flower development, the main cannabis product. Given the role of MADS box genes in flower identity, we analyzed and reorganized all the genomic and transcriptomic data available for homeotic genes, trying to decipher the applicability of the ABCDE model in Cannabis. Finally, reviewing the limits of the conventional breeding methods traditionally applied for developing new varieties, we proposed a new breeding scheme for the constitution of F(1) hybrids, without ignoring the indisputable contribution offered by genomics. In this sense, in parallel, we resumed the main advances in the genomic field of this species and, ascertained the lack of a robust set of SNP markers, provided a discriminant and polymorphic panel of SSR markers as a valuable tool for future marker assisted breeding programs.

AB  - The MADS-box gene family expanded in the lineage leading to the moss, Physcomitrella patens , mainly as a result of polyploidisations and/or large-scale segmental duplication events and to a lesser extent by tandem duplications. Plant MADS-box genes comprise a large family best known for the roles of type II MIKC (C) genes in floral organogenesis, but also including type II MIKC* genes, some of which have been implicated in male gametophytic development, and type I genes, a few of which are involved in ontogeny of female gametophytes, seeds and embryos. Genome-wide analyses of the MADS-box family in angiosperms have revealed numeric predominance of type I and MIKC (C) genes and cross-species phylogenetic clustering of the Malpha, Mbeta and Mgamma subtypes of type I genes and of 12 major subgroups of MIKC (C) genes. The genome sequence of Physcomitrella patens has facilitated investigation of its full complement of 26 MADS-box genes, including 6 MIKC (C) genes, 11 MIKC* genes, seven type I genes and two pseudogenes. A much higher degree of similarity in sequence and architecture within the MIKC (C) and MIKC* gene subtypes exists in Physcomitrella than in Arabidopsis. Furthermore, MADS-box and K-box sequence is highly conserved between the MIKC (C) and MIKC* subgroups in Physcomitrella. Nine MIKC* genes and two MIKC (C) genes are located in pairs or triplets on individual DNA scaffolds. Phylogenetic gene clustering, gene architectures and gene linkages (directly determined from examination of the genome sequence) underpin a parsimonious model of two tandem duplications and three segmental duplication events, which can account for lineage-specific expansion of the MADS-box gene family in Physcomitrella from 4 members to 26. Two of these segmental duplication events may be indicative of polyploidisations, one of which has been postulated previously.

AB  - Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) have widely acknowledged roles in the regulation of development, but few studies have addressed the timing and mechanism of shifting PPIs over evolutionary history. The B-class MADS-box transcription factors, PISTILLATA (PI) and APETALA3 (AP3) are key regulators of floral development. PI-like (PI(L)) and AP3-like (AP3(L)) proteins from a number of plants, including Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) and the grass Zea mays (maize), bind DNA as obligate heterodimers. However, a PI(L) protein from the grass relative Joinvillea can bind DNA as a homodimer. To ascertain whether Joinvillea PI(L) homodimerization is an anomaly or indicative of broader trends, we characterized PI(L) dimerization across the Poales and uncovered unexpected evolutionary lability. Both obligate B-class heterodimerization and PI(L) homodimerization have evolved multiple times in the order, by distinct molecular mechanisms. For example, obligate B-class heterodimerization in maize evolved very recently from PI(L) homodimerization. A single amino acid change, fixed during domestication, is sufficient to toggle one maize PI(L) protein between homodimerization and obligate heterodimerization. We detected a signature of positive selection acting on residues preferentially clustered in predicted sites of contact between MADS-box monomers and dimers, and in motifs that mediate MADS PPI specificity in Arabidopsis. Changing one positively selected residue can alter PI(L) dimerization activity. Furthermore, ectopic expression of a Joinvillea PI(L) homodimer in Arabidopsis can homeotically transform sepals into petals. Our results provide a window into the evolutionary remodeling of PPIs, and show that novel interactions have the potential to alter plant form in a context-dependent manner.

AB  - MADS-box transcription factors (TFs) are ubiquitous in eukaryotic organisms and play major roles during plant development. Nevertheless, their function in seed development remains largely unknown. Here, we show that the imprinted Arabidopsis thaliana MADS-box TF PHERES1 (PHE1) is a master regulator of paternally expressed imprinted genes, as well as of non-imprinted key regulators of endosperm development. PHE1 binding sites show distinct epigenetic modifications on maternal and paternal alleles, correlating with parental-specific transcriptional activity. Importantly, we show that the CArG-box-like DNA-binding motifs that are bound by PHE1 have been distributed by RC/Helitron transposable elements. Our data provide an example of the molecular domestication of these elements which, by distributing PHE1 binding sites throughout the genome, have facilitated the recruitment of crucial endosperm regulators into a single transcriptional network.

AB  - MADS-box genes encode a family of transcription factors which control diverse developmental processes in flowering plants ranging from root to flower and fruit development. Sequencing of (almost) the complete Arabidopsis genome enabled the identification of (almost) all of the Arabidopsis MADS-box genes. MADS-box genes have been divided in two large groups, termed type I and type II genes. The type II genes comprise the MEF2-like genes of animals and fungi and the MIKC-type genes of plants. The majority of MIKC-type genes are of the MIKC(c)-type, which includes all plant MADS-box genes for which expression patterns or mutant phenotypes are known. By phylogeny reconstruction, almost all of the MIKC(c)-type genes can be subdivided into 12 major gene clades, each clade comprising 1-6 paralogs from Arabidopsis and putative orthologs from other seed plants. Here we first briefly describe the deep branching of the MADS-box gene tree to place the MIKC(c)-type genes into an evolutionary context. For every clade of MIKC(c)-type genes we then review what is known about its members from Arabidopsis and well-studied members from other phylogenetically informative plant species. By gene sampling and phylogeny reconstructions we provide minimal estimates for the ages of the different clades. It turns out that 7 of the 12 major gene clades, i.e., AG-, AGL6-, AGL12-, DEF+GLO- (B), GGM13- (B(s)), STMADS11- and TM3-like genes very likely existed already in the most recent common ancestor of angiosperms and gymnosperms about 300MYA. Three of the other clades, i.e., AGL2-, AGL17-, and SQUA-like genes, existed at least already in the most recent common ancestor of monocots and eudicots about 200 MYA. Only for two gene clades, AGL15-like genes (2 genes in Arabidopsis) and FLC-like genes (6 genes) members from plants other than Brassicaceae have not been reported yet. Similarly, only one ancient clade known from other flowering plant species, TM8-like genes, is not represented in Arabidopsis. These findings reveal that the diversity of MADS-box genes in Arabidopsis is rather ancient and representative for other flowering plants. Our studies may thus help to predict the set of MADS-box genes in all other flowering plants, except for relatively young paralogs. For the different gene clades we try to identify ancestral and derived gene functions and review the importance of these clades for seed plant development and evolution. We put special emphasis on gene clades for which insights into their importance has rapidly increased just recently.

AB  - MADS-box genes encode a family of transcription factors which control diverse developmental processes in flowering plants ranging from root development to flower and fruit development. Through phylogeny reconstructions, most of these genes can be subdivided into defined monophyletic gene clades whose members share similar expression patterns and functions. Therefore, the establishment of the diversity of gene clades was probably an important event in land plant evolution. In order to determine when these clades originated, we isolated cDNAs of 19 different MADS-box genes from Gnetum gnemon, a gymnosperm model species and thus a representative of the sister group of the angiosperms. Phylogeny reconstructions involving all published MADS-box genes were then used to identify gene clades containing putative orthologs from both angiosperm and gymnosperm lineages. Thus, the minimal number of MADS-box genes that were already present in the last common ancestor of extant gymnosperms and angiosperms was determined. Comparative expression studies involving pairs of putatively orthologous genes revealed a diversity of patterns that has been largely conserved since the time when the angiosperm and gymnosperm lineages separated. Taken together, our data suggest that there were already at least seven different MADS-box genes present at the base of extant seed plants about 300 MYA. These genes were probably already quite diverse in terms of both sequence and function. In addition, our data demonstrate that the MADS-box gene families of extant gymnosperms and angiosperms are of similar complexities.

AB  - Members of the plant type I MADS domain subfamily have been reported to be involved in reproductive development in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). However, from the 61 type I genes in the Arabidopsis genome, only PHERES1, AGAMOUS-LIKE80 (AGL80), DIANA, AGL62, and AGL23 have been functionally characterized, which revealed important roles for these genes during female gametophyte and early seed development. The functions of the other genes are still unknown, despite the fact that the available single T-DNA insertion mutants have been largely investigated. The lack of mutant phenotypes is likely due to a considerable number of recent intrachromosomal duplications in the type I subfamily, resulting in nonfunctional genes in addition to a high level of redundancy. To enable a breakthrough in type I MADS box gene characterization, a framework needs to be established that allows the prediction of the functionality and redundancy of the type I genes. Here, we present a complete atlas of their expression patterns during female gametophyte and seed development in Arabidopsis, deduced from reporter lines containing translational fusions of the genes to green fluorescent protein and beta-glucuronidase. All the expressed genes were revealed to be active in the female gametophyte or developing seed, indicating that the entire type I subfamily is involved in reproductive development in Arabidopsis. Interestingly, expression was predominantly observed in the central cell, antipodal cells, and chalazal endosperm. The combination of our expression results with phylogenetic and protein interaction data allows a better identification of putative redundantly acting genes and provides a useful tool for the functional characterization of the type I MADS box genes in Arabidopsis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The transition from vegetative to floral phase is the result of complex crosstalk of exogenous and endogenous floral integrators. This critical physiological event is the response to environmental interaction, which causes biochemical cascades of reactions at different internal tissues, organs, and releases signals that make the plant moves from vegetative status to a reproductive phase. This network controlling flowering time is not deciphered largely in bread wheat. In this study, a comparative transcriptome analysis at a transition time in combination with genetic mapping was used to identify responsible genes in a stage and tissue-specific manner. For this reason, two winter cultivars that have been bred in Germany showing contrasting and stable heading time in different environments were selected for the analysis. RESULTS: In total, 670 and 1075 differentially expressed genes in the shoot apical meristem and leaf tissue, respectively, could be identified in 23 QTL intervals for the heading date. In the transition apex, Histone methylation H3-K36 and regulation of circadian rhythm are both controlled by the same homoeolog genes mapped in QTL TaHd112, TaHd124, and TaHd137. TaAGL14 gene that identifies the floral meristem was mapped in TaHd054 in the double ridge. In the same stage, the homoeolog located on chromosome 7D of FLOWERING TIME LOCUS T mapped on chr 7B, which evolved an antagonist function and acts as a flowering repressor was uncovered. The wheat orthologue of transcription factor ASYMMETRIC LEAVES 1 (AS1) was identified in the late reproductive stage and was mapped in TaHd102, which is strongly associated with heading date. Deletion of eight nucleotides in the AS1 promoter could be identified in the binding site of the SUPPRESSOR OF CONSTANS OVEREXPRESSION 1 (SOC1) gene in the late flowering cultivar. Both proteins AS1 and SOC1 are inducing flowering time in response to gibberellin biosynthesis. CONCLUSION: The global transcriptomic at the transition phase uncovered stage and tissue-specific genes mapped in QTL of heading date in winter wheat. In response to Gibberellin signaling, wheat orthologous transcription factor AS1 is expressed in the late reproductive phase of the floral transition. The locus harboring this gene is the strongest QTL associated with the heading date trait in the German cultivars. Consequently, we conclude that this is another indication of the Gibberellin biosynthesis as the mechanism behind the heading variation in wheat.

AB  - As maize (Zea mays) plants undergo vegetative phase change from juvenile to adult, they both exhibit heteroblasty, an abrupt change in patterns of leaf morphogenesis, and gain the ability to produce flowers. Both processes are under the control of microRNA156 (miR156), whose levels decline at the end of the juvenile phase. Gain of the ability to flower is conferred by the expression of miR156 targets that encode SQUAMOSA PROMOTER-BINDING transcription factors, which, when derepressed in the adult phase, induce the expression of MADS box transcription factors that promote maturation and flowering. How gene expression, including targets of those microRNAs, differs between the two phases remains an open question. Here, we compare transcript levels in primordia that will develop into juvenile or adult leaves to identify genes that define these two developmental states and may influence vegetative phase change. In comparisons among successive leaves at the same developmental stage, plastochron 6, three-fourths of approximately 1,100 differentially expressed genes were more highly expressed in primordia of juvenile leaves. This juvenile set was enriched in photosynthetic genes, particularly those associated with cyclic electron flow at photosystem I, and in genes involved in oxidative stress and retrograde redox signaling. Pathogen- and herbivory-responsive pathways including salicylic acid and jasmonic acid also were up-regulated in juvenile primordia; indeed, exogenous application of jasmonic acid delayed both the appearance of adult traits and the decline in the expression of miR156-encoding loci in maize seedlings. We hypothesize that the stresses associated with germination promote juvenile patterns of differentiation in maize.

AB  - Speciation involves reproductive isolation, which can occur by hybridization barriers acting in the endosperm of the developing seed. The nuclear endosperm is a nutrient sink, accumulating sugars from surrounding tissues, and undergoes coordinated cellularization, switching to serve as a nutrient source for the developing embryo. Tight regulation of cellularization is therefore vital for seed and embryonic development. Here we show that hybrid seeds from crosses between Arabidopsis thaliana as maternal contributor and A. arenosa or A. lyrata as pollen donors result in an endosperm based post-zygotic hybridization barrier that gives rise to a reduced seed germination rate. Hybrid seeds display opposite endosperm cellularization phenotypes, with late cellularization in crosses with A. arenosa and early cellularization in crosses with A. lyrata. Stage specific endosperm reporters display temporally ectopic expression in developing hybrid endosperm, in accordance with the early and late cellularization phenotypes, confirming a disturbance of the source-sink endosperm phase change. We demonstrate that the hybrid barrier is under the influence of abiotic factors, and show that a temperature gradient leads to diametrically opposed cellularization phenotype responses in hybrid endosperm with A. arenosa or A. lyrata as pollen donors. Furthermore, different A. thaliana accession genotypes also enhance or diminish seed viability in the two hybrid cross-types, emphasizing that both genetic and environmental cues control the hybridization barrier. We have identified an A. thaliana MADS-BOX type I family single locus that is required for diametrically opposed cellularization phenotype responses in hybrid endosperm. Loss of AGAMOUS-LIKE 35 significantly affects the germination rate of hybrid seeds in opposite directions when transmitted through the A. thaliana endosperm, and is suggested to be a locus that promotes cellularization as part of an endosperm based mechanism involved in post-zygotic hybrid barriers. The role of temperature in hybrid speciation and the identification of distinct loci in control of hybrid failure have great potential to aid the introduction of advantageous traits in breeding research and to support models to predict hybrid admixture in a changing global climate.

AB  - Protein-protein interactions are an integral part of all biological processes in the cells as they play a crucial role in regulating, maintaining, and amending cellular functions. These interactions are involved in a wide range of phenomena such as signal transduction, pathogen response, cell-cell interactions, metabolic and developmental processes. In the case of transcription factors, these interactions may lead to oligomerization of subunits, sequestering in specific subcellular contexts such as the nucleus, cytoplasm, etc., which, in turn, might have a more profound effect on the expression of the downstream genes. Here, we demonstrate a methodology to visualize in vivo tripartite interaction using Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation (BiFC) based Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) involving Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging (FLIM). Two of the proteins selected for this demonstration interact as BiFC partners, and their reconstituted fluorescence activity is used to assay FRET-FLIM with the third partner. Four to five-week-old growth-chamber-grown Nicotiana benthamiana plants have been used as the model plant system for this demonstration.

AB  - Arabidopsis thaliana diverged from A. arenosa and A. lyrata at least 6 million years ago. The three species differ by genome-wide polymorphisms and morphological traits. The species are to a high degree reproductively isolated, but hybridization barriers are incomplete. A special type of hybridization barrier is based on the triploid endosperm of the seed, where embryo lethality is caused by endosperm failure to support the developing embryo. The MADS-box type I family of transcription factors is specifically expressed in the endosperm and has been proposed to play a role in endosperm-based hybridization barriers. The gene family is well known for its high evolutionary duplication rate, as well as being regulated by genomic imprinting. Here we address MADS-box type I gene family evolution and the role of type I genes in the context of hybridization. Using two de-novo assembled and annotated chromosome-level genomes of A. arenosa and A. lyrata ssp. petraea we analyzed the MADS-box type I gene family in Arabidopsis to predict orthologs, copy number, and structural genomic variation related to the type I loci. Our findings were compared to gene expression profiles sampled before and after the transition to endosperm cellularization in order to investigate the involvement of MADS-box type I loci in endosperm-based hybridization barriers. We observed substantial differences in type-I expression in the endosperm of A. arenosa and A. lyrata ssp. petraea, suggesting a genetic cause for the endosperm-based hybridization barrier between A. arenosa and A. lyrata ssp. petraea.

AB  - In Arabidopsis thaliana, stomata are composed of two guard cells that control the aperture of a central pore to facilitate gas exchange between the plant and its environment, which is particularly important during photosynthesis. Although leaves are the primary photosynthetic organs of flowering plants, floral organs are also photosynthetically active. In the Brassicaceae, evidence suggests that silique photosynthesis is important for optimal seed oil content. A group of transcription factors containing MADS DNA binding domains is necessary and sufficient to confer floral organ identity. Elegant models, such as the ABCE model of flower development and the floral quartet model, have been instrumental in describing the molecular mechanisms by which these floral organ identity proteins govern flower development. However, we lack a complete understanding of how the floral organ identity genes interact with the underlying leaf development program. Here, we show that the MADS domain transcription factor AGAMOUS (AG) represses stomatal development on the gynoecial valves, so that maturation of stomatal complexes coincides with fertilization. We present evidence that this regulation by AG is mediated by direct transcriptional repression of a master regulator of the stomatal lineage, MUTE, and show data that suggests this interaction is conserved among several members of the Brassicaceae. This work extends our understanding of the mechanisms underlying floral organ formation and provides a framework to decipher the mechanisms that control floral organ photosynthesis.

AB  - According to the classical ABC model, B-function genes are involved in determining petal and stamen development. Most core eudicot species have B class genes belonging to three different lineages: the PI, euAP3, and TM6 lineages, although both Arabidopsis and Antirrhinum appear to have lost their TM6-like gene. Functional studies were performed for three gerbera (Gerbera hybrida) B class MADS-box genes--PI/GLO-like GGLO1, euAP3 class GDEF2, and TM6-like GDEF1--and data are shown for a second euAP3-like gene, GDEF3. In phylogenetic analysis, GDEF3 is a closely related paralogue of GDEF2, and apparently stems from a duplication common to all Asteraceae. Expression analysis and transgenic phenotypes confirm that GGLO1 and GDEF2 mediate the classical B-function since they determine petal and stamen identities. However, based on assays in yeast, three B class heterodimer combinations are possible in gerbera. In addition to the interaction of GGLO1 and GDEF2 proteins, GGLO1 also pairs with GDEF1 and GDEF3. This analysis of GDEF1 represents the first functional characterization of a TM6-like gene in a core eudicot species outside Solanaceae. Similarly to its relatives in petunia and tomato, the expression pattern and transgenic phenotypes indicate that GDEF1 is not involved in determination of petal identity, but has a redundant role in regulating stamen development.

AB  - Although MADS-box genes involved in flower and fruit development have been well characterized, the function of MADS-box genes expressed in vegetative structures has yet to be explored. At least seven members of this family are grouped in clades of genes that are preferentially expressed in roots of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh.. We report here the cloning of the AGL21 MADS-box gene, which belongs to the ANR1 clade, and the mRNA in situ expression patterns of this and two other root MADS-box genes. AGL17 appears to be a lateral root cap marker in the root tip, and towards the elongation zone this gene is expressed in the epidermal cells. AGL21 is highly expressed in lateral root primordia and it has a punctate expression pattern in the primary root meristem. AGL12 also has a punctate expression pattern in the primary root meristem. AGL12 and AGL21 are also expressed in the central cylinder of differentiated roots and both are expressed in developing embryos. This study, combined with previous phylogenetic analyses, indicates that these MADS-box genes may play distinct regulatory roles during root development.

AB  - This work represents the first epigenomic study carried out on saffron crocus. Five accessions of saffron, showing differences in tepal pigmentation, yield of saffron and flowering time, were analyzed at the epigenetic level by applying a methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme-sequencing (MRE-seq) approach. Five accession-specific hypomethylomes plus a reference hypomethylome, generated by combining the sequence data from the single accessions, were obtained. Assembled sequences were annotated against existing online databases. In the absence of the Crocus genome, the rice genome was mainly used as the reference as it is the best annotated genome among monocot plants. Comparison of the hypomethylomes revealed many differentially methylated regions, confirming the high epigenetic variability present among saffron accessions, including sequences encoding for proteins that could be good candidates to explain the accessions' alternative phenotypes. In particular, transcription factors involved in flowering process (MADS-box and TFL) and for the production of pigments (MYB) were detected. Finally, by comparing the generated sequences of the different accessions, a high number of SNPs, likely having arisen as a consequence of the prolonged vegetative propagation, were detected, demonstrating surprisingly high genetic variability. Gene ontology (GO) was performed to map and visualize sequence polymorphisms located within the GOs and to compare their distributions among different accessions. As well as suggesting the possible existence of alternative phenotypes with a genetic basis, a clear difference in polymorphic GO is present among accessions based on their geographic origin, supporting a possible signature of selection in the Indian accession with respect to the Spanish ones.

AB  - Double flower is an invaluable trait in ornamental peach, but the mechanism underlying its development remains largely unknown. Here, we report the roles of ABCE model genes in double flower development in peach. A total of nine ABCE regulatory genes, including eight MADS-box genes and one AP2/EREBP gene, were identified in the peach genome. Subcellular localization assay showed that all the ABCE proteins were localized in the nucleus. Four genes, PpAP1, PpAP3, PpSEP3, and PpPI, showed a difference in expression levels between single and double flowers. Ectopic overexpression of PpPI increased petal number in Arabidopsis, while transgenic lines overexpressing PpAP3 or PpSEP3 were morphologically similar to wild-type. Ectopic overexpression of PpAP1 resulted in a significant decrease in the number of basal leaves and caused early flowering. These results suggest that PpPI is likely crucial for double flower development in peach. In addition, double flowers have petaloid sepals and stamens, and single flower could occasionally change to be double flower by converting stamens to petals in peach, suggesting that the double-flower trait is likely to have evolved from an ancestral single-flower structure. Our results provide new insights into mechanisms underlying the double-flower trait in peach.

AB  - Tandem gene clusters of multigene families are rearrangement hotspots and may be a major source of novel gene formation. Here, we report on a molecular population genetic analysis of the MAF2-5 gene cluster of the model plant species, Arabidopsis thaliana. The MAF2-5 genes are a MADS-box multigene family cluster spanning approximately 24 kbp on chromosome 5. We find heterogeneous evolutionary dynamics among these genes, all of which are closely related to the floral repressor, FLC, and are believed to play a role in the control of flowering time in A. thaliana. Low levels of nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) observed for MAF4 and MAF5 suggest purifying selection and conservation of function. In contrast, high levels of nonsynonymous SNPs, insertion-deletion, and rearrangements are observed for MAF2 and MAF3, including novel gene fusions that persist as a moderate-frequency polymorphism in A. thaliana. These fused genes, involving MAF2 and portions of MAF3, are expressed, resulting in the production of chimeric, alternatively spliced transcripts of MAF2. Association studies support a correlation between the described MAF2-MAF3 gene rearrangements and flowering time variation in the species. The finding that complex rearrangements within gene clusters, such as those observed for MAF2, might play a role in the generation of ecologically important phenotypic variation, emphasize the need for emerging high throughput genotyping and sequencing techniques to correctly reconstruct gene chimeras and other complex polymorphisms.

AB  - Dormancy release and bloom time of sweet cherry cultivars depend on the environment and the genotype. The knowledge of these traits is essential for cultivar adaptation to different growing areas, and to ensure fruit set in the current climate change scenario. In this work, the major sweet cherry bloom time QTL qP-BT1.1 (m) (327 Kbs; Chromosome 1) was scanned for candidate genes in the Regina cv genome. Six MADS-box genes (PavDAMs), orthologs to peach and Japanese apricot DAMs, were identified as candidate genes for bloom time regulation. The complete curated genomic structure annotation of these genes is reported. To characterize PavDAMs intra-specific variation, genome sequences of cultivars with contrasting chilling requirements and bloom times (N = 13), were then mapped to the 'Regina' genome. A high protein sequence conservation (98.8-100%) was observed. A higher amino acid variability and several structural mutations were identified in the low-chilling and extra-early blooming cv Cristobalina. Specifically, a large deletion (694 bp) upstream of PavDAM1, and various INDELs and SNPs in contiguous PavDAM4 and -5 UTRs were identified. PavDAM1 upstream deletion in 'Cristobalina' revealed the absence of several cis-acting motifs, potentially involved in PavDAMs expression. Also, due to this deletion, a non-coding gene expressed in late-blooming 'Regina' seems truncated in 'Cristobalina'. Additionally, PavDAM4 and -5 UTRs mutations revealed different splicing variants between 'Regina' and 'Cristobalina' PavDAM5. The results indicate that the regulation of PavDAMs expression and post-transcriptional regulation in 'Cristobalina' may be altered due to structural mutations in regulatory regions. Previous transcriptomic studies show differential expression of PavDAM genes during dormancy in this cultivar. The results indicate that 'Cristobalina' show significant amino acid differences, and structural mutations in PavDAMs, that correlate with low-chilling and early blooming, but the direct implication of these mutations remains to be determined. To complete the work, PCR markers designed for the detection of 'Cristobalina' structural mutations in PavDAMs, were validated in an F(2) population and a set of cultivars. These PCR markers are useful for marker-assisted selection of early blooming seedlings, and probably low-chilling, from 'Cristobalina', which is a unique breeding source for these traits.

AB  - To study the early steps of flower initiation and development in grapevine (grapes; Vitis vinifera), we have isolated two MADS-box genes, VFUL-L and VAP1, the putative FUL-like and AP1 grapevine orthologs, and analyzed their expression patterns during vegetative and reproductive development. Both genes are expressed in lateral meristems that, in grapevine, can give rise to either inflorescences or tendrils. They are also coexpressed in inflorescence and flower meristems. During flower development, VFUL-L transcripts are restricted to the central part of young flower meristems and, later, to the prospective carpel-forming region, which is consistent with a role of this gene in floral transition and carpel and fruit development. Expression pattern of VAP1 suggests that it may play a role in flowering transition and flower development. However, its lack of expression in sepal primordia, does not support its role as an A-function gene in grapevine. Neither VFUL-L nor VAP1 expression was detected in vegetative organs such as leaves or roots. In contrast, they are expressed throughout tendril development. Transcription of both genes in tendrils of very young plants that have not undergone flowering transition indicates that this expression is independent of the flowering process. These unique expression patterns of genes typically involved in reproductive development have implications on our understanding of flower induction and initiation in grapevine, on the origin of grapevine tendrils and on the functional roles of AP1-and FUL-like genes in plant development. These results also provide molecular support to the hypothesis that Vitis tendrils are modified reproductive organs adapted to climb.

AB  - In deciduous fruit trees, entrance into dormancy occurs in later summer/fall, concomitantly with the shortening of day length and decrease in temperature. Dormancy can be divided into endodormancy, ecodormancy and paradormancy. In Prunus species flower buds, entrance into the dormant stage occurs when the apical meristem is partially differentiated; during dormancy, flower verticils continue their growth and differentiation. Each species and/or cultivar requires exposure to low winter temperature followed by warm temperatures, quantified as chilling and heat requirements, to remove the physiological blocks that inhibit budburst. A comprehensive meta-analysis of transcriptomic studies on flower buds of sweet cherry, apricot and peach was conducted, by investigating the gene expression profiles during bud endo- to ecodormancy transition in genotypes differing in chilling requirements. Conserved and distinctive expression patterns were observed, allowing the identification of gene specifically associated with endodormancy or ecodormancy. In addition to the MADS-box transcription factor family, hormone-related genes, chromatin modifiers, macro- and micro-gametogenesis related genes and environmental integrators, were identified as novel biomarker candidates for flower bud development during winter in stone fruits. In parallel, flower bud differentiation processes were associated to dormancy progression and termination and to environmental factors triggering dormancy phase-specific gene expression.

AB  - Progression through the plant life cycle involves change in many essential features, most notably in the capacity to reproduce. The transition from a juvenile vegetative and non-reproductive to an adult reproductive phase is gradual and can take many years; in the conifer Norway spruce, Picea abies, typically 20-25 years. We present a detailed analysis of the activities of three regulatory genes with potential roles in this transition in Norway spruce: DAL1, a MADS-box gene related to the AGL6 group of genes from angiosperms, and the two LEAFY-related genes PaLFY and PaNLY. DAL1 activity is initiated in the shoots of juvenile trees at an age of 3-5 years, and then increases with age, whereas both LFY genes are active throughout the juvenile phase. The activity of DAL1 further shows a spatial pattern along the stem of the tree that parallels a similar gradient in physiological and morphological features associated with maturation to the adult phase. Constitutive expression of DAL1 in transgenic Arabidopsis plants caused a dramatic attenuation of both juvenile and adult growth phases; flowers forming immediately after the embryonic phase of development in severely affected plants. Taken together, our results support the notion that DAL1 may have a regulatory role in the juvenile-to-adult transition in Norway spruce.

AB  - A cDNA clone, STMADS11, encoding a new MADS-box protein was isolated from Solanum tuberosum L. (potato). Expression of STMADS11 was found in all vegetative organs of the plant, but not in floral tissues. The expression was also detected in all developmental stages, from tuber sprouts to mature plants, reaching a maximum in well-developed organs. However, the level of STMADS11 mRNA was low in tissues such as resting tuber or sprouts developed in the cold, where the metabolic activity is reduced. "In situ" hybridizations performed on leaf and stem sections showed that the STMADS11 transcript is mainly associated with vascular bundles. Cladistic analysis arising from amino acid sequence comparison revealed that STMADS11 shows the highest similarity to STMADS16, another vegetative MADS-box gene from potato, and to the previously reported "orphan" genes AGL15 and AGL17 from Arabidopsis thaliana. Possible implications of these data in relation to STMADS11 function are discussed.

AB  - Plants, as sessile organisms, adapt to different stressful conditions, such as drought, salinity, extreme temperatures, and nutrient deficiency, via plastic developmental and growth responses. Depending on the intensity and the developmental phase in which it is imposed, a stress condition may lead to a broad range of responses at the morphological, physiological, biochemical, and molecular levels. Transcription factors are key components of regulatory networks that integrate environmental cues and concert responses at the cellular level, including those that imply a stressful condition. Despite the fact that several studies have started to identify various members of the MADS-box gene family as important molecular components involved in different types of stress responses, we still lack an integrated view of their role in these processes. In this review, we analyze the function and regulation of MADS-box gene family members in response to drought, salt, cold, heat, and oxidative stress conditions in different developmental processes of several plants. In addition, we suggest that MADS-box genes are key components of gene regulatory networks involved in plant responses to stress and plant developmental plasticity in response to seasonal changes in environmental conditions.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The juvenile to adult transition (JAT) in higher plants is required for them to reach reproductive competence. However, it is a poorly understood process in woody plants, where only a few genes have been definitely identified as being involved in this transition. This work aims at increasing our understanding of the mechanisms regulating the JAT in citrus. METHODS: Juvenile and adult plants from Pineapple sweet orange (Citrus sinensis) and Rough lemon (C. jambhiri) were used to screen for differentially expressed transcription factors (TFs) using a 1.15K microarray developed on the basis of the CitrusTF database. Murcott tangor (C. reticulata x C. sinensis) and Duncan grapefruit (C. paradisi) were incorporated into the quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR validation in order to select those genes whose phase-specific regulation was common to the four species. KEY RESULTS: A browsable web database has been created with information about the structural and functional annotation related to 1152 unigenes of putative citrus TFs (CTFs). This database constitutes a valuable resource for research on transcriptional regulation and comparative genomics. Moreover, a microarray has been developed and used that contains these putative CTFs, in order to identify eight genes that showed differential expression in juvenile and adult meristems of four different species of citrus. Those genes have been characterized, and their expression pattern in vegetative and reproductive tissues has been analysed. Four of them are MADS-box genes, a family of TFs involved in developmental processes, whereas another one resembles MADS-box genes but lacks the MADS box itself. The other three showed high partial sequence similarity restricted to specific Arabidopsis protein domains but negligible outside those domains. CONCLUSIONS: The work presented here indicates that the JAT in citrus could be controlled by mechanisms that are in part common to those of Arabidopsis, but also somehow different, since specific factors without Arabidopsis orthologues have also been characterized. The potential involvement of the genes in the JAT is discussed.

AB  - Plant organ primordia develop successively at the shoot apical meristem (SAM). In Arabidopsis, primordia formed early in development differentiate into vegetative leaves, whereas those formed later generate inflorescence branches and flowers. TERMINAL FLOWER 1 (TFL1), a negative regulator of transcription, acts in the SAM to delay flowering and to maintain inflorescence meristem indeterminacy. We used confocal microscopy, time-resolved transcript profiling and reverse genetics to elucidate this dual role of TFL1. We found that TFL1 accumulates dynamically in the SAM reflecting its dual function. Moreover, TFL1 represses two major sets of genes. One set includes genes that promote flowering, expression of which increases earlier in tfl1 mutants. The other set is spatially misexpressed in tfl1 inflorescence meristems. The misexpression of these two gene sets in tfl1 mutants depends upon FD transcription factor, with which TFL1 interacts. Furthermore, the MADS-box gene SEPALLATA 4, which is upregulated in tfl1, contributes both to the floral transition and shoot determinacy defects of tfl1 mutants. Thus, we delineate the dual function of TFL1 in shoot development in terms of its dynamic spatial distribution and different modes of gene repression.

AB  - PREMISE: One evolutionary path from hermaphroditism to dioecy is via a gynodioecious intermediate. The evolution of dioecy may also coincide with the formation of sex chromosomes that possess sex-determining loci that are physically linked in a region of suppressed recombination. Dioecious papaya (Carica papaya) has an XY chromosome system, where the presence of a Y chromosome determines maleness. However, in cultivation, papaya is gynodioecious, due to the conversion of the male Y chromosome to a hermaphroditic Y(h) chromosome during its domestication. METHODS: We investigated gene expression linked to the X, Y, and Y(h) chromosomes at different floral developmental stages to identify differentially expressed genes that may be involved in the sexual transition of males to hermaphrodites. RESULTS: We identified 309 sex-biased genes found on the sex chromosomes, most of which are found in the pseudoautosomal regions. Female (XX) expression in the sex-determining region was almost double that of X-linked expression in males (XY) and hermaphrodites (XY(h) ), which rules out dosage compensation for most sex-linked genes; although, an analysis of hemizygous X-linked loci found evidence of partial dosage compensation. Furthermore, we identified a candidate gene associated with sex determination and the transition to hermaphroditism, a homolog of the MADS-box protein SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a pattern of partial dosage compensation for hemizygous genes located in the papaya sex-determining region. Furthermore, we propose that loss-of-expression of the Y-linked SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE homolog facilitated the transition from males to hermaphrodites in papaya.

AB  - Based on previous researches, we further investigated the multi-silique trait in rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) line zws-ms. In this study, we used a relatively comprehensive list of flowering related genes in rapeseed and compared them between zws-ms and its near-isogenic line (NIL) zws-217. Genes were studied on genome, transcriptome and proteome levels and then we focused on genes with non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) or frame-shift insertion-deletion (InDel), finding some genes on the list which changes their sequences. Then, combined with their annotation and the information of their orthologs, certain genes such as BnaA09g05900D, ortholog of AGAMOUS-LIKE 42 (AGL42), which encodes an MADS-box protein, were assumed as probably responsible for the multi-silique trait. Also, we analyzed the Differentially Accumulated Proteins (DAPs) between zws-ms and zws-217, revealing some genes involved in homologous recombination and mismatch repair pathways. Since the development of flowers/siliques is crucial to crops and it influences the yield of rapeseed, this study paved a way to deeply understand the mechanism of the multi-pistil flower formation, which may facilitate researches on rapeseed production in future.

AB  - To investigate sepal/petal/lip formation in Oncidium Gower Ramsey, three paleoAPETALA3 genes, O. Gower Ramsey MADS box gene5 (OMADS5; clade 1), OMADS3 (clade 2), and OMADS9 (clade 3), and one PISTILLATA gene, OMADS8, were characterized. The OMADS8 and OMADS3 mRNAs were expressed in all four floral organs as well as in vegetative leaves. The OMADS9 mRNA was only strongly detected in petals and lips. The mRNA for OMADS5 was only strongly detected in sepals and petals and was significantly down-regulated in lip-like petals and lip-like sepals of peloric mutant flowers. This result revealed a possible negative role for OMADS5 in regulating lip formation. Yeast two-hybrid analysis indicated that OMADS5 formed homodimers and heterodimers with OMADS3 and OMADS9. OMADS8 only formed heterodimers with OMADS3, whereas OMADS3 and OMADS9 formed homodimers and heterodimers with each other. We proposed that sepal/petal/lip formation needs the presence of OMADS3/8 and/or OMADS9. The determination of the final organ identity for the sepal/petal/lip likely depended on the presence or absence of OMADS5. The presence of OMADS5 caused short sepal/petal formation. When OMADS5 was absent, cells could proliferate, resulting in the possible formation of large lips and the conversion of the sepal/petal into lips in peloric mutants. Further analysis indicated that only ectopic expression of OMADS8 but not OMADS5/9 caused the conversion of the sepal into an expanded petal-like structure in transgenic Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants.

AB  - Mutants have proven to be a key resource for functional genomic studies in model annual plant species. In perennial plant species where mutants are difficult to generate and to screen, spontaneous somatic variants represent a unique resource to understand the genetic control of complex developmental patterns. The morphological and histological characterization of six Vitis vinifera L. somatic variants that display four different abnormal phenotypes of flower development are described here. A phenotype of reiterated reproductive meristems (RRM), with both flower and petal reiteration, was observed in a somatic variant of the cultivar Carignan. An abnormal development of reproductive organs was displayed by the unfused carpels (UFC) somatic variant of cv. Bouchales, while a somatic variant of cv. Mourvedre named carpel-less (CLS) developed abnormal ovules in the absence of carpels. Finally, three independent somatic variants in cvs Gamay, Morrastel, and Pinot displayed a phenotype of multiple perianth whorls (MPW). Gene expression studies showed that the expression profiles of VvMADS-box 1, 2, and 3 (putative orthologues of Arabidopsis flowering genes AG, SEP, and AGL13), were altered during grapevine flower development in the somatic variants, whereas the corresponding original cultivars displayed similar VvMADS-box gene expression profiles. Phenotypic and molecular characterization of these variants allowed the development of hypotheses on genetic functions that might be altered in most of the variants in light of the current ABCDE flower model.

AB  - Post-embryonic plant development is characterized by a period of vegetative growth during which a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic signals triggers the transition to the reproductive phase. To understand how different flowering inducing and repressing signals are associated with phase transitions of the Shoot Apical Meristem (SAM), we incorporated available data into a dynamic gene regulatory network model for Arabidopsis thaliana. This Flowering Transition Gene Regulatory Network (FT-GRN) formally constitutes a dynamic system-level mechanism based on more than three decades of experimental data on flowering. We provide novel experimental data on the regulatory interactions of one of its twenty-three components: a MADS-box transcription factor XAANTAL2 (XAL2). These data complement the information regarding flowering transition under short days and provides an example of the type of questions that can be addressed by the FT-GRN. The resulting FT-GRN is highly connected and integrates developmental, hormonal, and environmental signals that affect developmental transitions at the SAM. The FT-GRN is a dynamic multi-stable Boolean system, with 2(23) possible initial states, yet it converges into only 32 attractors. The latter are coherent with the expression profiles of the FT-GRN components that have been experimentally described for the developmental stages of the SAM. Furthermore, the attractors are also highly robust to initial states and to simulated perturbations of the interaction functions. The model recovered the meristem phenotypes of previously described single mutants. We also analyzed the attractors landscape that emerges from the postulated FT-GRN, uncovering which set of signals or components are critical for reproductive competence and the time-order transitions observed in the SAM. Finally, in the context of such GRN, the role of XAL2 under short-day conditions could be understood. Therefore, this model constitutes a robust biological module and the first multi-stable, dynamical systems biology mechanism that integrates the genetic flowering pathways to explain SAM phase transitions.

AB  - Early seed development events are highly sensitive to increased temperature. This high sensitivity to a short-duration temperature spike reduces seed viability and seed size at maturity. The molecular basis of heat stress sensitivity during early seed development is not known. We selected rice (Oryza sativa), a highly heat-sensitive species, to explore this phenomenon. Here, we elucidate the molecular pathways that contribute to the heat sensitivity of a critical developmental window during which the endosperm transitions from syncytium to the cellularization stage in young seeds. A transcriptomic comparison of seeds exposed to moderate (35 degrees C) and severe (39 degrees C) heat stress with control (28 degrees C) seeds identified a set of putative imprinted genes, which were down-regulated under severe heat stress. Several type I MADS box genes specifically expressed during the syncytial stage were differentially regulated under moderate and severe heat stress. The suppression and overaccumulation of these genes are associated with precocious and delayed cellularization under moderate and severe stress, respectively. We show that modulating the expression of OsMADS87, one of the heat-sensitive, imprinted genes associated with syncytial stage endosperm, regulates rice seed size. Transgenic seeds deficient in OsMADS87 exhibit accelerated endosperm cellularization. These seeds also have lower sensitivity to a moderate heat stress in terms of seed size reduction compared with seeds from wild-type plants and plants overexpressing OsMADS87 Our findings suggest that OsMADS87 and several other genes identified in this study could be potential targets for improving the thermal resilience of rice during reproductive development.

AB  - MIKC(c)-type MADS-box genes encode transcription factors that control floral organ morphogenesis and flowering time in flowering plants. Here, in order to determine when the subfamilies of MIKC(c) originated and their early evolutionary trajectory, we sampled and analyzed the genomes and large-scale transcriptomes representing all the orders of gymnosperms and basal angiosperms. Through phylogenetic inference, the MIKC(c)-type MADS-box genes were subdivided into 14 monophyletic clades. Among them, the gymnosperm orthologs of AGL6, SEP, AP1, GMADS, SOC1, AGL32, AP3/PI, SVP, AGL15, ANR1, and AG were identified. We identified and characterized the origin of a novel subfamily GMADS within gymnosperms but lost orthologs in monocots and Brassicaceae. ABCE model prototype genes were relatively conserved in terms of gene number in gymnosperms, but expanded in angiosperms, whereas SVP, SOC1, and GMADS had dramatic expansions in gymnosperms but conserved in angiosperms. Our results provided the most detailed evolutionary history of all MIKC(c) gene clades in gymnosperms and angiosperms. We proposed that although the near complete set of MIKC(c) genes had evolved in gymnosperms, the duplication and expressional transition of ABCE model MIKC(c) genes in the ancestor of angiosperms triggered the first flower.

AB  - The MADS-box gene family controls plant flowering and floral organ development; therefore, it is particularly important in ornamental plants. To investigate the genes associated with the MADS-box family in Clematis courtoisii, we performed full-length transcriptome sequencing on C. courtoisii using the PacBio Sequel third-generation sequencing platform, as no reference genome data was available. A total of 12.38 Gb of data, containing 9,476,585 subreads and 50,439 Unigenes were obtained. According to functional annotation, a total of 37,923 Unigenes (75.18% of the total) were assigned with functional annotations, and 50 Unigenes were identified as MADS-box related genes. Subsequently, we employed hmmerscan to perform protein sequence similarity search for the translated Unigene sequences and successfully identified 19 Unigenes associated with the MADS-box gene family, including MIKC*(1) and MIKCC (18) genes. Furthermore, within the MIKCC group, six subclasses can be further distinguished.

AB  - The ectopic expression of a MADS box gene FOREVER YOUNG FLOWER (FYF) caused a significant delay of senescence and a deficiency of abscission in flowers of transgenic Arabidopsis. The defect in floral abscission was found to be due to a deficiency in the timing of cell separation of the abscission zone cells. Down-regulation of INFLORESCENCE DEFICIENT IN ABSCISSION (IDA) may contribute to the delay of the floral abscission in 35S:FYF flowers. FYF was found to be highly expressed in young flowers prior to pollination and was significantly decreased after pollination, a pattern that correlated with its function. Ethylene insensitivity in senescence/abscission and the down-regulation of ETHYLENE RESPONSE DNA-BINDING FACTOR 1 (EDF1) and EDF2, downstream genes in the ethylene response, in 35S:FYF Arabidopsis suggested a role for FYF in regulating senescence/abscission by suppressing the ethylene response. This role was further supported by the fact that 35S:FYF enhanced the delay of flower senescence/abscission in ethylene response 1 (etr1), ethylene-insensitive 2 (ein2) and constitutive triple response 1 (ctr1) mutants, which have defects in upstream genes of the ethylene signaling pathway. The presence of a repressor domain in the C-terminus of FYF and the enhancement of the delay of senescence/abscission in FYF+SRDX (containing a suppression motif) transgenic plants suggested that FYF acts as a repressor. Indeed, in FYF-DR+VP16 transgenic dominant-negative mutant plants, in which FYF was converted to a potent activator by fusion to a VP16-AD motif, the senescence/abscission of the flower organs was significantly promoted, and the expression of BOP2, IDA and EDF1/2 was up-regulated. Our data suggest a role for FYF in controlling floral senescence/abscission by repressing ethylene responses and regulating the expression of BOP2 and IDA in Arabidopsis.

AB  - The ectopic expression of FOREVER YOUNG FLOWER (FYF), a MADS box gene in Arabidopsis, caused significant delay of senescence and a deficiency of abscission in flowers of transgenic Arabidopsis. It was proposed that the function of the FYF gene was related to the regulation of senescence and abscission. This hypothesis was further supported by one line of evidence reported in this study. The evidence is the similar delay of flower senescence and abscission observed in transgenic Arabidopsis ectopically expressing OnFYF, an FYF homolog from the Oncidium orchid, a monocot. This data suggested that the function of FYF homologs in regulating flower senescence and abscission was highly conserved in both dicot and monocot plants.

AB  - Gene expression during seed development in Arabidopsis thaliana is controlled by transcription factors including LEAFY COTYLEDON1 (LEC1) and LEC2, ABA INSENSITIVE3 (ABI3), FUSCA3 (FUS3), known as LAFL proteins, and AGAMOUS-LIKE15 (AGL15). The transition from seed maturation to germination and seedling growth requires the transcriptional silencing of these seed maturation-specific factors leading to downregulation of structural genes including those that encode seed storage proteins, oleosins, and dehydrins. During seed germination and vegetative growth, B3-domain protein HSI2/VAL1 is required for the transcriptional silencing of LAFL genes. Here, we report chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis indicating that HSI2/VAL1 binds to the upstream sequences of the AGL15 gene but not at LEC1, ABI3, FUS3, or LEC2 loci. Functional analysis indicates that the HSI2/VAL1 B3 domain interacts with two RY elements upstream of the AGL15 coding region and at least one of them is required for HSI2/VAL1-dependent AGL15 repression. Expression analysis of the major seed maturation regulatory genes LEC1, ABI3, FUS3, and LEC2 in different genetic backgrounds demonstrates that HSI2/VAL1 is epistatic to AGL15 and represses the seed maturation regulatory program through downregulation of AGL15 by deposition of H3K27me3 at this locus. This hypothesis is further supported by results that show that HSI2/VAL1 physically interacts with the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 component protein MSI1, which is also enriched at the AGL15 locus.

AB  - The MADS-box transcription factors are known to be involved in several aspects of plant growth and development, especially in floral organ specification. However, little is known in eggplant. Here, 120 eggplant MADS-box genes were identified and categorized into type II (MIKCC and MIKC*) and type I (Malpha, Mbeta, and Mgamma) subfamilies based on phylogenetic relationships. The exon number in type II SmMADS-box genes was greater than that in type I SmMADS-box genes, and the K-box domain was unique to type II MADS-box TFs. Gene duplication analysis revealed that segmental duplications were the sole contributor to the expansion of type II genes. Cis-elements of MYB binding sites related to flavonoid biosynthesis were identified in three SmMADS-box promoters. Flower tissue-specific expression profiles showed that 46, 44, 38, and 40 MADS-box genes were expressed in the stamens, stigmas, petals, and pedicels, respectively. In the flowers of SmMYB113-overexpression transgenic plants, the expression levels of 3 SmMADS-box genes were co-regulated in different tissues with the same pattern. Correlation and protein interaction predictive analysis revealed six SmMADS-box genes that might be involved in the SmMYB113-regulated anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway. This study will aid future studies aimed at functionally characterizing important members of the MADS-box gene family.

AB  - MADS-box family transcription factors play essential roles in the growth and development of plants, and some MADS-box genes have also been found to participate in the stress-response. At present, little information regarding stress-related MADS-box genes is available in pepper. We isolated a MADS-box transcription factor gene from Capsicum annuum, which we named CaMADS. CaMADS expression is induced by low and high temperature, salt, and osmotic stress, and also by abscisic acid (ABA), salicylic acid (SA), methyl-jasmonic acid (MeJA), and CaCl(2.) To understand the function of CaMADS in the abiotic stress response, we generated pepper plants in which CaMADS expression was down-regulated using VIGS (Virus-induced Gene Silencing), and also transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing CaMADS. We found that CaMADS-down-regulated seedlings were more seriously injured than WT after cold, NaCl, and mannitol treatment, and showed increased electrolyte leakage, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, and lower chlorophyll content. CaMADS-overexpressing Arabidopsis plants were more tolerant to these stresses than WT, and showed significantly high survival rates and lower H(2)O(2) and super oxide radical contents after cold treatment. CaMADS-overexpressing plants had higher germination rates and percentages of green cotyledons following NaCl and mannitol treatment. Root lengths and fresh weight in CaMADS-overexpressing plants were also significantly longer and higher, respectively, than in WT plants. Taken together, our results suggest that CaMADS functions as a positive stress-responsive transcription factor in the cold, salt, and osmotic stress signaling pathways.

AB  - Bud dormancy helps woody perennials survive winter and activate robust plant development in the spring. For apple (Malus x domestica), short-term chilling induces bud dormancy in autumn, then prolonged chilling leads to dormancy release and a shift to a quiescent state in winter, with subsequent warm periods promoting bud break in spring. Epigenetic regulation contributes to seasonal responses such as vernalization. However, how histone modifications integrate seasonal cues and internal signals during bud dormancy in woody perennials remains largely unknown. Here, we show that H3K4me3 plays a key role in establishing permissive chromatin states during bud dormancy and bud break in apple. The global changes in gene expression strongly correlated with changes in H3K4me3, but not H3K27me3. High expression of DORMANCY-ASSOCIATED MADS-box (DAM) genes, key regulators of dormancy, in autumn was associated with high H3K4me3 levels. In addition, known DAM/SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) target genes significantly overlapped with H3K4me3-modified genes as bud dormancy progressed. These data suggest that H3K4me3 contributes to the central dormancy circuit, consisting of DAM/SVP and abscisic acid (ABA), in autumn. In winter, the lower expression and H3K4me3 levels at DAMs and gibberellin metabolism genes control chilling-induced release of dormancy. Warming conditions in spring facilitate the expression of genes related to phytohormones, the cell cycle, and cell wall modification by increasing H3K4me3 toward bud break. Our study also revealed that activation of auxin and repression of ABA sensitivity in spring are conditioned at least partly through temperature-mediated epigenetic regulation in winter.

AB  - Gynostemium and ovule development in orchid are unique developmental processes in the plant kingdom. Characterization of C- and D-class MADS-box genes could help reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying gynostemium and ovule development in orchids. In this study, we isolated and characterized a C- and a D-class gene, PeMADS1 and PeMADS7, respectively, from Phalaenopsis equestris. These two genes showed parallel spatial and temporal expression profiles, which suggests their cooperation in gynostemium and ovule development. Furthermore, only PeMADS1 was ectopically expressed in the petals of the gylp (gynostemium-like petal) mutant, whose petals were transformed into gynostemium-like structures. Protein-protein interaction analyses revealed that neither PeMADS1 and PeMADS7 could form a homodimer or a heterodimer. An E-class protein was needed to bridge the interaction between these two proteins. A complementation test revealed that PeMADS1 could rescue the phenotype of the AG mutant. Overexpression of PeMADS7 in Arabidopsis caused typical phenotypes of the D-class gene family. Together, these results indicated that both C-class PeMADS1 and D-class PeMADS7 play important roles in orchid gynostemium and ovule development.

AB  - The transition from vegetative to reproductive growth is important for controlling the flowering of Lycoris radiata. However, the genetic control of this complex developmental process remains unclear. In this study, 18 shoot apical meristem (SAM) samples were collected from early-, mid- and late-flowering populations during floral bud differentiation. The histological analysis of paraffin sections showed that the floral bud differentiation could be divided into six stages; the differentiation time of the early group was earlier than that of the middle and late groups, and the late group was the latest. In different populations, some important differential genes affecting the flowering time were identified by transcriptome profiles of floral bud differentiation samples. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed to enrich the gene co-expression modules of diverse flowering time populations (FT) and floral bud differentiation stages (ST). In the MEyellow module, five core hub genes were identified, including CO14, GI, SPL8, SPL9, and SPL15. The correlation network of hub genes showed that they interact with SPLs, AP2, hormone response factors (auxin, gibberellin, ethylene, and abscisic acid), and several transcription factors (MADS-box transcription factor, bHLH, MYB, and NAC3). It suggests the important role of these genes and the complex molecular mechanism of floral bud differentiation and flowering time in L. radiata. These results can preliminarily explain the molecular mechanism of floral bud differentiation and provide new candidate genes for the flowering regulation of Lycoris.

AB  - Paphiopedilum (Orchidaceae) is one of the world's most popular orchids that is found in tropical and subtropical forests and has an enormous ornamental value. SEPALLATA-like (SEP-like) MADS-box genes are responsible for floral organ specification. In this study, three SEP-like MADS-box genes, PhSEP1, PhSEP2, and PhSEP3, were identified in Paphiopedilum henryanum. These genes were 732-916 bp, with conserved SEPI and SEPII motifs. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that PhSEP genes were evolutionarily closer to the core eudicot SEP3 lineage, whereas none of them belonged to core eudicot SEP1/2/4 clades. PhSEP genes displayed non-ubiquitous expression, which was detectable across all floral organs at all developmental stages of the flower buds. Furthermore, subcellular localization experiments revealed the localization of PhSEP proteins in the nucleus. Yeast two-hybrid assays revealed no self-activation of PhSEPs. The protein-protein interactions revealed that PhSEPs possibly interact with B-class DEFICIENS-like and E-class MADS-box proteins. Our study suggests that the three SEP-like genes may play key roles in flower development in P. henryanum, which will improve our understanding of the roles of the SEP-like MADS-box gene family and provide crucial insights into the mechanisms underlying floral development in orchids.

AB  - The MADS-box gene plays an important role in plant growth and development. As an important vegetable of Cucurbitaceae, chayote has great edible and medicinal value. So far, there is little molecular research on chayote, and there are no reports on the MADS-box transcription factor of chayote. In this study, the MADS-box gene family of chayote was analyzed for the first time, and a total of 70 MADS-box genes were identified, including 14 type I and 56 type II MICK MADS genes. They were randomly distributed on 13 chromosomes except for chromosome 11. The light response element, hormone response element and abiotic stress response element were found in the promoter region of 70 MADS genes, indicating that the MADS gene can regulate the growth and development of chayote, resist abiotic stress, and participate in hormone response; GO and KEGG enrichment analysis also found that SeMADS genes were mainly enriched in biological regulation and signal regulation, which further proved the important role of MADS-box gene in plant growth and development. The results of collinearity showed that segmental duplication was the main driving force of MADS gene expansion in chayote. RNA-seq showed that the expression levels of SeMADS06, SeMADS13, SeMADS26, SeMADS28, SeMADS36 and SeMADS37 gradually increased with the growth of chayote, indicating that these genes may be related to the development of root tubers of 'Tuershao'. The gene expression patterns showed that 12 SeMADS genes were specifically expressed in the male flower in 'Tuershao' and chayote. In addition, SeMADS03 and SeMADS52 may be involved in regulating the maturation of male flowers of 'Tuershao' and chayote. SeMADS21 may be the crucial gene in the development stage of the female flower of 'Tuershao'. This study laid a theoretical foundation for the further study of the function of the MADS gene in chayote in the future.

AB  - MADS-box gene family plays an important role in the molecular regulatory network of flower development. APETALA1 (AP1), a MADS-box gene, plays an important role in the development of flower organs. Although many studies about MADS-box family genes have been reported, the function of AP1 is still not clear in cotton. In this study, GhAP1.7 (Gh_D03G0922), a candidate gene for cotton flower time and plant height obtained from our previous studies, was cloned from CCRI50 cotton variety and functionally characterized. Subcellular localization demonstrated that GhAP1.7 was located in nucleus. Infection test of Arabidopsis revealed that GhAP1.7 could cause precocious flowering and virus-induced gene silence (VIGS) assay demonstrated that GhAP1.7 could lead to delayed flowering of cotton plants. Yeast one-hybrid assays and transient dual-luciferase assays suggested that floral meristem identity control gene LEAFY (LFY) can bind the promoter of GhAP1.7 and negatively regulate it. Our research indicated that GhAP1.7 might work as a positive regulator in plant flowering. Moreover, GhAP1.7 may negatively regulated by GhLFY in the regulatory pathways. This work laid the foundation for subsequent functional studies of GhAP1.7.

AB  - Mini chromosome maintenance 1, agamous, deficiens, and serum response factor (MADS)-box genes are transcription factors which play fundamental roles in flower development and regulation of floral organ identity. However, till date, identification and functions of MADS-box genes remain largely unclear in Phyllostachys edulis. In view of this, we performed a whole-genome survey and identified 34 MADS-box genes in P. edulis, and based on phylogeny, they were classified as MIKC(C), MIKC( *), Malpha, and Mbeta. The detailed analysis about gene structure and motifs, phylogenetic classification, comparison of gene divergence and duplication are provided. Interestingly, expression patterns for most genes were found similar to those of Arabidopsis and rice, indicating that the well-established ABCDE model can be applied to P. edulis. Moreover, we overexpressed PheMADS15, an AP1-like gene, in Arabidopsis, and found that the transgenic plants have early flowering phenotype, suggesting that PheMADS15 might be a regulator of flowering transition in P. edulis. Taken together, this study provides not only insightful comprehension but also useful information for understanding the functions of MADS-box genes in P. edulis.

AB  - MADS-domain proteins are important transcription factors involved in many aspects of plant reproductive development. In this study, a MADS-box gene, Glycine max AGAMOUS-LIKE1 (GmAGL1), was isolated from soybean flower. The transcript of GmAGL1 was expressed in flowers and pods of different stages in soybean and was highly expressed in carpels. GmAGL1 is a nucleus-localized transcription factor and can interact directly with SEP-like proteins in soybean flowers. Ectopic overexpression of GmAGL1 resulted in the absence of petals in Arabidopsis. Moreover, morphological changes in the valves were observed in 35S:GmAGL1 Arabidopsis fruits that dehisced before the seeds reached full maturity. GmAGL1 was found to be sufficient to activate the expression of Arabidopsis ALC, IND, STK, SEP1, and SEP3. Therefore, our data suggest that GmAGL1 may play important roles in both floral organ identity and fruit dehiscence.

AB  - The nuclear lamina, a sub-nuclear protein matrix, maintains nuclear structure and genome function. Here, we investigate the role of Arabidopsis lamin analogs CROWDED NUCLEIs during gametophyte and seed development. We observed defects in crwn mutant seeds, including seed abortion and reduced germination rate. Quadruple crwn null genotypes were rarely transmitted through gametophytes. We focused on the crwn1 crwn2 (crwn1/2) endosperm, which exhibited enlarged chalazal cysts and increased expression of stress-related genes and the MADS-box transcription factor PHERES1 and its targets. Previously, it was shown that PHERES1 is regulated by H3K27me3 and that CRWN1 interacts with the PRC2 interactor PWO1. Thus, we tested whether crwn1/2 alters H3K27me3 patterns. We observed a mild loss of H3K27me3 at several hundred loci, which differed between endosperm and leaves. These data indicate that CRWNs are necessary to maintain the H3K27me3 landscape, with tissue-specific chromatin and transcriptional consequences.

AB  - Floral homeotic MADS-box transcription factors ensure the correct morphogenesis of floral organs, which are organized in different cell layers deriving from distinct meristematic layers. How cells from these distinct layers acquire their respective identities and coordinate their growth to ensure normal floral organ morphogenesis is unresolved. Here, we studied petunia (Petunia x hybrida) petals that form a limb and tube through congenital fusion. We identified petunia mutants (periclinal chimeras) expressing the B-class MADS-box gene DEFICIENS in the petal epidermis or in the petal mesophyll, called wico and star, respectively. Strikingly, wico flowers form a strongly reduced tube while their limbs are almost normal, while star flowers form a normal tube but greatly reduced and unpigmented limbs, showing that petunia petal morphogenesis is highly modular. These mutants highlight the layer-specific roles of PhDEF during petal development. We explored the link between PhDEF and petal pigmentation, a well-characterized limb epidermal trait. The anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway was strongly downregulated in star petals, including its major regulator ANTHOCYANIN2 (AN2). We established that PhDEF directly binds to the AN2 terminator in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that PhDEF might regulate AN2 expression and therefore petal epidermis pigmentation. Altogether, we show that cell layer-specific homeotic activity in petunia petals differently impacts tube and limb development, revealing the relative importance of the different cell layers in the modular architecture of petunia petals.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The MADS-box transcription factors mainly function in floral organ organogenesis and identity specification. Few research on their roles in vegetative growth has been reported. RESULTS: Here we investigated the functions of OsMADS57 in plant vegetative growth in rice (Oryza sativa). Knockdown of OsMADS57 reduced the plant height, internode elongation and panicle exsertion in rice plants. Further study showed that the cell length was remarkably reduced in the uppermost internode in OsMADS57 knockdown plants at maturity. Moreover, OsMADS57 knockdown plants were more sensitive to gibberellic acid (GA(3)), and contained less bioactive GA(3) than wild-type plants, which implied that OsMADS57 is involved in gibberellin (GA) pathway. Expectedly, the transcript levels of OsGA2ox3, encoding GAs deactivated enzyme, were significantly enhanced in OsMADS57 knockdown plants. The level of EUI1 transcripts involved in GA deactivation was also increased in OsMADS57 knockdown plants. More importantly, dual-luciferase reporter assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that OsMADS57 directly regulates the transcription of OsGA2ox3 as well as EUI1 through binding to the CArG-box motifs in their promoter regions. In addition, OsMADS57 also modulated the expression of multiple genes involved in GA metabolism or GA signaling pathway, indicating the key and complex regulatory role of OsMADS57 in GA pathway in rice. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicated that OsMADS57 acts as an important transcriptional regulator that regulates stem elongation and panicle exsertion in rice via GA-mediated regulatory pathway.

AB  - Regulation of flowering time is best understood in the dicot model species Arabidopsis thaliana. Molecular analyses revealed that genes belonging to the MADS box transcription factor family play pivotal regulatory roles in both the vernalization- and photoperiod-regulated flowering pathways. Here the analysis of three APETALA1 (AP1)-like MADS box proteins (LpMADS1-3) and a SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP)-like MADS box protein (LpMADS10) from the monocot perennial grass species Lolium perenne is reported. Features of these MADS box proteins were studied by yeast two-hybrid assays. Protein-protein interactions among the Lolium proteins and with members of the Arabidopsis MADS box family have been studied. The expression pattern for LpMADS1 and the protein properties suggest that not the Arabidopsis AP1 gene, but the SUPPRESSOR OF CONSTANS1 (SOC1) gene, is the functional equivalent of LpMADS1. To obtain insight into the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of LpMADS1 gene expression in vernalization-sensitive and -insensitive Lolium accessions, the upstream sequences of this gene from a winter and spring growth habit variety were compared with respect to MADS box protein binding. In both promoter elements, a putative MADS box transcription factor-binding site (CArG-box) is present; however, the putative spring promoter has a short deletion adjacent to this DNA motif. Experiments using yeast one-hybrid and gel retardation assays demonstrated that the promoter element is bound by an LpMADS1-LpMADS10 higher order protein complex and, furthermore, that this complex binds efficiently to the promoter element from the winter variety only. This strongly supports the model that LpMADS1 together with LpMADS10 controls the vernalization-dependent regulation of the LpMADS1 gene, which is part of the vernalization-induced flowering process in Lolium.

AB  - Angiosperm seed development is a paradigm of tissue cross-talk. Proper seed formation requires spatial and temporal coordination of the fertilization products - embryo and endosperm - and the surrounding seed coat maternal tissue. In early Arabidopsis seed development, all seed integuments were thought to respond homogenously to endosperm growth. Here, we show that the sub-epidermal integument cell layer has a unique developmental program. We characterized the cell patterning of the sub-epidermal integument cell layer, which initiates a previously uncharacterized extra cell layer, and identified TRANSPARENT TESTA 16 and SEEDSTICK MADS box transcription factors as master regulators of its polar development and cell architecture. Our data indicate that the differentiation of the sub-epidermal integument cell layer is insensitive to endosperm growth alone and to the repressive mechanism established by FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT ENDOSPERM and MULTICOPY SUPPRESSOR OF IRA1 Polycomb group proteins. This work demonstrates the different responses of epidermal and sub-epidermal integument cell layers to fertilization.

AB  - BACKGROUND: MADS-box genes are key regulators of plant reproductive development and members of most lineages of this gene family have been extensively studied. However, the function and diversification of the ancient TM8 lineage remains elusive to date. The available data suggest a possible function in flower development in tomato and fast evolution through numerous gene loss events in flowering plants. RESULTS: We show the broad conservation of TM8 within angiosperms and find that in contrast to other MADS-box gene lineages, no gene duplicates have been retained after major whole genome duplication events. Through knock-down of NbTM8 by virus induced gene silencing in Nicotiana benthamiana, we show that NbTM8 represses miR172 together with another MADS-box gene, SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (NbSVP). In the closely related species Petunia hybrida, PhTM8 is not expressed under the conditions we investigated and consistent with this, a knock-out mutant did not show a phenotype. Finally, we generated transgenic tomato plants in which TM8 was silenced or ectopically expressed, but these plants did not display a clear phenotype. Therefore, no clear function could be confirmed for Solanum lycopersium. CONCLUSIONS: While the presence of TM8 is generally conserved, it remains difficult to propose a general function in angiosperms. Based on all the available data to date, supplemented with our own results, TM8 function seems to have diversified quickly throughout angiosperms and acts as repressor of miR172 in Nicotiana benthamiana, together with NbSVP.

AB  - In contrast to the wealth of information relating to genes regulating floral meristem and floral organ identity, only limited data are available concerning genes that are involved in determining and regulating the identity and development of an ovule. We have recently isolated the floral binding protein 11 (FBP11) MADS box gene from petunia and found that it is expressed exclusively in ovule primordia and subsequently in the ovules, suggesting a role for this gene in ovule formation. To test this hypothesis, we constructed a recombinant gene in which the full-size FBP11 cDNA was placed under the control of a strong cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. Transgenic petunia plants expressing this chimeric gene have ovulelike structures on the adaxial side of the sepals and the abaxial side of the petals. Detailed morphological studies showed that these ovulelike structures are true ovules. RNA gel blot analysis was performed to investigate ectopic FBP11 expression in relation to the expression of the closely related FBP7 gene and the putative petunia class C-type homeotic genes FBP6 and pMADS3. Our results indicate that FBP11 represents an ovule identity gene. A new model describing the mode of action of FBP11 as an additional class D MADS box gene is presented.

AB  - MADS-box transcription factors are key regulators of plant developmental processes. While the function of MIKC (type II) MADS-box genes has been intensively studied, only limited data are available for the other more recently identified classes of MADS-box genes, despite these latter comprising more than 60% of the Arabidopsis MADS-box gene family. Here we describe the function of AGL23, an Arabidopsis type I MADS-box gene belonging to the Malpha subfamily. We show that AGL23 plays an important role during development of the female gametophyte and embryo. The agl23-1 mutant forms a functional megaspore. However, at this stage female gametophyte development is arrested and the megaspore persists during subsequent phases of ovule development. Despite the incomplete penetrance of the female gametophyte defect, plants homozygous for the agl23-1 mutation were never identified. Analysis of developing seeds showed that embryos homozygous for the agl23-1 allele are albino and unable to give rise to viable plants. Electron microscopy analysis revealed that this phenotype is due to the absence of chloroplasts, strongly suggesting that AGL23 is involved in controlling the biogenesis of organelles during embryo development.

AB  - MADS-box transcription factors are important regulators of floral organ identity through their binding to specific motifs, termed CArG, in the promoter of their target genes. Petal initiation and development depend on class A and B genes, but MADS-box genes of the APETALA3 (AP3) clade are key regulators of this process. In the early diverging eudicot Nigella damascena, an apetalous [T] morph is characterized by the lack of expression of the NdAP3-3 gene, with its expression being petal-specific in the wild-type [P] morph. All [T] morph plants are homozygous for an NdAP3-3 allele with a Miniature Inverted-repeat Transposable Element (MITE) insertion in the second intron of the gene. Here, we investigated to which extent the MITE insertion impairs regulation of the NdAP3-3 gene. We found that expression of NdAP3-3 is initiated in the [T] morph, but the MITE insertion prevents its positive self-maintenance by affecting the correct splicing of the mRNA. We also found specific CArG features in the promoter of the NdAP3-3 genes with petal-specific expression. However, they are not sufficient to drive expression only in petals of transgenic Arabidopsis, highlighting the existence of Nigella-specific cis/trans-acting factors in regulating AP3 paralogs.

AB  - The genus Passiflora comprises a large group of plants popularly known as passionfruit, much appreciated for their exotic flowers and edible fruits. The species ( approximately 500) are morphologically variable (e.g., growth habit, size, and color of flowers) and are adapted to distinct tropical ecosystems. In this study, we generated the genome of the wild diploid species Passiflora organensis Gardner by adopting a hybrid assembly approach. Passiflora organensis has a small genome of 259 Mbp and a heterozygosity rate of 81%, consistent with its reproductive system. Most of the genome sequences could be integrated into its chromosomes with cytogenomic markers (satellite DNA) as references. The repeated sequences accounted for 58.55% of the total DNA analyzed, and the Tekay lineage was the prevalent retrotransposon. In total, 25,327 coding genes were predicted. Passiflora organensis retains 5,609 singletons and 15,671 gene families. We focused on the genes potentially involved in the locus determining self-incompatibility and the MADS-box gene family, allowing us to infer expansions and contractions within specific subfamilies. Finally, we recovered the organellar DNA. Structural rearrangements and two mitoviruses, besides relics of other mobile elements, were found in the chloroplast and mt-DNA molecules, respectively. This study presents the first draft genome assembly of a wild Passiflora species, providing a valuable sequence resource for genomic and evolutionary studies on the genus, and support for breeding cropped passionfruit species.

AB  - Plant reproductive development from the first appearance of reproductively committed axes through to floral maturation requires massive and rapid remarshalling of gene expression. In dioecious species such as poplar this is further complicated by divergent male and female developmental programs. We used seven time points in male and female balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera L.) buds and catkins representing the full annual flowering cycle, to elucidate the effects of time and sex on gene expression during reproductive development. Time (developmental stage) is dominant in patterning gene expression with the effect of sex nested within this. Here, we find (1) evidence for five successive waves of alterations to the chromatin landscape which may be important in setting the overall reproductive trajectory, regardless of sex. (2) Each individual developmental stage is further characterized by marked sex-differential gene expression. (3) Consistent sexually differentiated gene expression regardless of developmental stage reveal candidates for high-level regulators of sex and include the female-specific poplar ARR17 homologue. There is also consistent male-biased expression of the MADS-box genes PISTILLATA and APETALA3. Our work provides insights into expression trajectories shaping reproductive development, its potential underlying mechanisms, and sex-specific translation of the genome information into reproductive structures in balsam poplar.

AB  - In a past article, our lab described the identification and characterization of a novel vegetative MADS-box gene from quaking aspen trees, Populus tremuloides MADS-box 5 (PTM5). PTM5 was shown to be a member of the SOC1/TM3 class of MADS-box genes with a seasonal expression pattern specific to developing vascular tissues including the vascular cambium, the precursor to all woody branches, stems, and roots. Since the proper function of MADS-box proteins is dependent on specific interactions with other regulatory proteins, we further examined PTM5 protein-protein interactions as a means to better understand its function. Through yeast two-hybrid analyses, it was demonstrated that, like other SOC1/TM3 class proteins, PTM5 is capable of interacting with itself as well as other MADS-box proteins from aspen. In addition, yeast two-hybrid library screening revealed that PTM5 interacts with two non-MADS proteins, an actin depolymerizing factor (PtADF) and a novel leucine-rich repeat protein (PtLRR). In situ RNA localization was used to verify the overlapping expression patterns of these genes, and transgenic studies showed that over-expression of PTM5 in aspen causes alterations in root vasculature and root biomass development consistent with the cell growth and expansion functions of related ADF and LRR genes. These results suggest that the interaction of vegetative MADS-box genes with specific protein cofactors is a key step in the mechanisms that control woody tissue development in trees.

AB  - Plant trichomes are specialized epidermal cells that protect plants from insects and pathogens. In Arabidopsis, epidermal hairs decrease as internodes increase in height, with only few epidermal hairs produced on the sepals abaxial surface of the early flowers. TRIPTYCHON (TRY) is known to be a negative regulator of epidermal hair development in Arabidopsis, suppressing the formation of ectopic epidermal hairs in the inflorescence. Here, we reported that the second intron of TRY gene plays a critical role in trichome spatial distribution in Arabidopsis. The expression of TRY rises with the increasing stem nodes and reaches the peak in the inflorescence, while the trichomes distribution decrease. The transgenic plants showed that TRY promoter could only drive the genomic instead of coding sequences combined with GUS reporter gene, which indicates that the regulatory elements of TRY expression in inflorescence could be located in the intron regions. Multiple SPLs and MADS-box binding sites were found in the TRY intron2 sequence. Further genetic and biochemistry assays revealed that the flowering-related genes such as SPL9 could bind to these cis-elements directly, contributing to the TRY spatial expression. Since cotton fiber and Arabidopsis trichomes share similar regulatory mechanism, extended analysis showed that the intron2 of cotton TRY genes also contain the cis-elements. Thus, the introns harboring the transcription element may be the general way to regulate the gene expression in different plants and provides molecular clues for the related crops' traits design.

AB  - We identified FLY as a previously uncharacterized RNA-binding-family protein that controls flowering time by positively regulating the expression of FLC clade members. The ability of flowering plants to adjust the timing of the floral transition based on endogenous and environmental signals contributes to their adaptive success. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the MADS-domain protein FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) and the FLC clade members FLOWERING LOCUS M/MADS AFFECTING FLOWERING1 (FLM/MAF1), MAF2, MAF3, MAF4, and MAF5 form nuclear complexes that repress flowering under noninductive conditions. However, how FLM/MAF genes are regulated requires further study. Using a genetic strategy, we showed that the previously uncharacterized K-homology (KH) domain protein FLOWERING LOCUS Y (FLY) modulates flowering time. The fly-1 knockout mutant and FLY artificial microRNA knockdown line flowered earlier than the wild type under long- and short-day conditions. The knockout fly-1 allele, a SALK T-DNA insertion mutant, contains an ~ 110-kb genomic deletion induced by T-DNA integration. FLC clade members were downregulated in the fly-1 mutants and FLY artificial microRNA knockdown line, whereas the level of the FLC antisense transcript COOLAIR was similar to that of the wild type. Our results identify FLY as a regulator that affects flowering time through upregulation of FLC clade members.

AB  - MIKC-type MADS-box genes, also known as type II genes, play a crucial role in regulating the formation of floral organs and reproductive development in plants. However, the genome-wide identification and characterization of type II genes as well as a transcriptomic survey of their potential roles in Carica papaya remain unresolved. Here, we identified and characterized 24 type II genes in the C. papaya genome, and investigated their evolutional scenario and potential roles with a widespread expression profile. The type II genes were divided into thirteen subclades, and gene loss events likely occurred in papaya, as evidenced by the contracted member size of most subclades. Gene duplication mainly contributed to MIKC-type gene formation in papaya, and the duplicated gene pairs displayed prevalent expression divergence, implying the evolutionary significance of gene duplication in shaping the diversity of type II genes in papaya. A large-scale transcriptome analysis of 152 samples indicated that different subclasses of these genes showed distinct expression patterns in various tissues, biotic stress response, and abiotic stress response, reflecting their divergent functions. The hub-network of male and female flowers and qRT-PCR suggested that TT16-3 and AGL8 participated in male flower development and seed germination. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the evolution and functions of MIKC-type genes in C. papaya.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The identity of flower organs is specified by various MIKC MADS-box transcription factors which act in a combinatorial manner. TM8 is a MADS-box gene that was isolated from the floral meristem of a tomato mutant more than twenty years ago, but is still poorly known from a functional point of view in spite of being present in both Angiosperms and Gymnosperms, with some species harbouring more than one copy of the gene. This study reports a characterization of TM8 that was carried out in transgenic tomato plants with altered expression of the gene. RESULTS: Tomato plants over-expressing either TM8 or a chimeric repressor form of the gene (TM8:SRDX) were prepared. In the TM8 up-regulated plants it was possible to observe anomalous stamens with poorly viable pollen and altered expression of several floral identity genes, among them B-, C- and E-function ones, while no apparent morphological modifications were visible in the other whorls. Oblong ovaries and fruits, that were also parthenocarpic, were obtained in the plants expressing the TM8:SRDX repressor gene. Such ovaries showed modified expression of various carpel-related genes. No apparent modifications could be seen in the other flower whorls. The latter plants had also epinastic leaves and malformed flower abscission zones. By using yeast two hybrid assays it was possible to show that TM8 was able to interact in yeast with MACROCALIX. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of the ectopically altered TM8 expression on the reproductive structures suggests that this gene plays some role in the development of the tomato flower. MACROCALYX, a putative A-function MADS-box gene, was expressed in all the four whorls of fully developed flowers, and showed quantitative variations that were opposite to those of TM8 in the anomalous stamens and ovaries. Since the TM8 protein interacted in vitro only with the A-function MADS-box protein MACROCALYX, it seems that for the correct differentiation of the tomato reproductive structures possible interactions between TM8 and MACROCALYX proteins might be important.

AB  - SYL3-k allele increases the outcrossing rate of male sterile line and the yield of hybrid F(1) seeds via enhancement of endogenous GA(4) content in Oryza sativa L. pistils. The change in style length might be an adaptation of rice cultivation from south to north in the northern hemisphere. The style length (SYL) in rice is one of the major factors influencing the stigma exertion, which affects the outcross rate of male sterile line and the yield of hybrid F(1) seeds. However, the biological mechanisms underlying SYL elongation remain elusive. Here, we report a map-based cloning and characterisation of the allele qSYL3-k. The qSYL3-k allele encodes a MADS-box family transcription factor, and it is expressed in various rice organs. The qSYL3-k allele increases SYL via the elongation of cell length in the style, which is associated with a higher GA(4) content in the pistil. The expression level of OsGA3ox2 in pistils with qSYL3-k alleles is significantly higher than that in pistils with qSYL3-n allele on the same genome background of Nipponbare. The yield of F(1) seeds harvested from plants with 7001S(SYL3-k) alleles was 16% higher than that from plants with 7001S(SYL3-n) allele. The sequence data at the qSYL3 locus in 136 accessions showed that alleles containing the haplotypes qSYL3(AA), qSYL3(AG), and qSYL3(GA) increased SYL, whereas those containing the haplotype qSYL3(GG) decreased it. The frequency of the haplotype qSYL3(GG) increases gradually from the south to north in the northern hemisphere. These findings will facilitate improvement in SYL and yield of F(1) seeds henceforward.

AB  - The switch from vegetative to reproductive growth is marked by the termination of vegetative development and the adoption of floral identity by the shoot apical meristem (SAM). This process is called the floral transition. To elucidate the molecular determinants involved in this process, we performed genome-wide RNA expression profiling on maize (Zea mays) shoot apices at vegetative and early reproductive stages using massively parallel signature sequencing technology. Profiling revealed significant up-regulation of two maize MADS-box (ZMM) genes, ZMM4 and ZMM15, after the floral transition. ZMM4 and ZMM15 map to duplicated regions on chromosomes 1 and 5 and are linked to neighboring MADS-box genes ZMM24 and ZMM31, respectively. This gene order is syntenic with the vernalization1 locus responsible for floral induction in winter wheat (Triticum monococcum) and similar loci in other cereals. Analyses of temporal and spatial expression patterns indicated that the duplicated pairs ZMM4-ZMM24 and ZMM15-ZMM31 are coordinately activated after the floral transition in early developing inflorescences. More detailed analyses revealed ZMM4 expression initiates in leaf primordia of vegetative shoot apices and later increases within elongating meristems acquiring inflorescence identity. Expression analysis in late flowering mutants positioned all four genes downstream of the floral activators indeterminate1 (id1) and delayed flowering1 (dlf1). Overexpression of ZMM4 leads to early flowering in transgenic maize and suppresses the late flowering phenotype of both the id1 and dlf1 mutations. Our results suggest ZMM4 may play roles in both floral induction and inflorescence development.

AB  - Most known floral homeotic genes belong to the MADS box family and their products act in combination to specify floral organ identity by an unknown mechanism. We have used a yeast two-hybrid system to investigate the network of interactions between the Antirrhinum organ identity gene products. Selective heterodimerization is observed between MADS box factors. Exclusive interactions are detected between two factors, DEFICIENS (DEF) and GLOBOSA (GLO), previously known to heterodimerize and control development of petals and stamens. In contrast, a third factor, PLENA (PLE), which is required for reproductive organ development, can interact with the products of MADS box genes expressed at early, intermediate and late stages. We also demonstrate that heterodimerization of DEF and GLO requires the K box, a domain not found in non-plant MADS box factors, indicating that the plant MADS box factors may have different criteria for interaction. The association of PLENA and the temporally intermediate MADS box factors suggests that part of their function in mediating between the meristem and organ identity genes is accomplished through direct interaction. These data reveal an unexpectedly complex network of interactions between the factors controlling flower development and have implications for the determination of organ identity.

AB  - We report the discovery of an Antirrhinum MADS-box gene, FARINELLI (FAR), and the isolation of far mutants by a reverse genetic screen. Despite striking similarities between FAR and the class C MADS-box gene PLENA (PLE), the phenotypes of their respective mutants are dramatically different. Unlike ple mutants, which show homeotic conversion of reproductive organs to perianth organs and a loss of floral determinacy, far mutants have normal flowers which are partially male-sterile. Expression studies of PLE and FAR, in wild-type and mutant backgrounds, show complex interactions between the two genes. Double mutant analysis reveals an unexpected, redundant negative control over the B-function MADS-box genes. This feature of the two Antirrhinum C-function-like genes is markedly different from the control of the inner boundary of the B-function expression domain in Arabidopsis, and we propose and discuss a model to account for these differences. The difference in phenotypes of mutants in two highly related genes illustrates the importance of the position within the regulatory network in determining gene function.

AB  - The type I MADS-box genes constitute a largely unexplored subfamily of the extensively studied MADS-box gene family, well known for its role in flower development. Genes of the type I MADS-box subfamily possess the characteristic MADS box but are distinguished from type II MADS-box genes by the absence of the keratin-like box. In this in silico study, we have structurally annotated all 47 members of the type I MADS-box gene family in Arabidopsis thaliana and exerted a thorough analysis of the C-terminal regions of the translated proteins. On the basis of conserved motifs in the C-terminal region, we could classify the gene family into three main groups, two of which could be further subdivided. Phylogenetic trees were inferred to study the evolutionary relationships within this large MADS-box gene subfamily. These suggest for plant type I genes a dynamic of evolution that is significantly different from the mode of both animal type I (SRF) and plant type II (MIKC-type) gene phylogeny. The presence of conserved motifs in the majority of these genes, the identification of Oryza sativa MADS-box type I homologues, and the detection of expressed sequence tags for Arabidopsis thaliana and other plant type I genes suggest that these genes are indeed of functional importance to plants. It is therefore even more intriguing that, from an experimental point of view, almost nothing is known about the function of these MADS-box type I genes.

AB  - The MIKC MADS-box gene family has been shaped by extensive gene duplications giving rise to subfamilies of genes with distinct functions and expression patterns. However, within these subfamilies the functional assignment is not that clear-cut, and considerable functional redundancy exists. One way to investigate the diversity in regulation present in these subfamilies is promoter sequence analysis. With the advent of genome sequencing projects, we are now able to exert a comparative analysis of Arabidopsis and poplar promoters of MADS-box genes belonging to the same subfamily. Based on the principle of phylogenetic footprinting, sequences conserved between the promoters of homologous genes are thought to be functional. Here, we have investigated the evolution of MADS-box genes at the promoter level and show that many genes have diverged in their regulatory sequences after duplication and/or speciation. Furthermore, using phylogenetic footprinting, a distinction can be made between redundancy, neo/nonfunctionalization, and subfunctionalization.

AB  - Interactions between proteins are essential for their functioning and the biological processes they control. The elucidation of interaction maps based on yeast studies is a first step toward the understanding of molecular networks and provides a framework of proteins that possess the capacity and specificity to interact. Here, we present a comprehensive plant protein-protein interactome map of nearly all members of the Arabidopsis thaliana MADS box transcription factor family. A matrix-based yeast two-hybrid screen of >100 members of this family revealed a collection of specific heterodimers and a few homodimers. Clustering of proteins with similar interaction patterns pinpoints proteins involved in the same developmental program and provides valuable information about the participation of uncharacterized proteins in these programs. Furthermore, a model is proposed that integrates the floral induction and floral organ formation networks based on the interactions between the proteins involved. Heterodimers between flower induction and floral organ identity proteins were observed, which point to (auto)regulatory mechanisms that prevent the activity of flower induction proteins in the flower.

AB  - MADS-domain transcription factors are essential for proper flower and seed development in angiosperms and their role in determination of floral organ identity can be described by the 'ABC model' of flower development. Recently, close relatives of the B-type genes were identified by phylogenetic studies, which are referred to as B(sister) (B(s)) genes. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a MADS-box B(s) member from petunia, designated FBP24. An fbp24 knock-down line appeared to closely resemble the Arabidopsis B(s) mutant abs and a detailed and comparative analysis led to the conclusion that both FBP24 and ABS are necessary to determine the identity of the endothelial layer within the ovule. Protein interaction studies revealed the formation of higher-order complexes between B(s)-C-E and B(s)-D-E type MADS-box proteins, suggesting involvement of these specific complexes in determination of endothelium identity. However, although there are many similarities between the two genes and their products and functions, interestingly FBP24 cannot replace ABS in Arabidopsis. The results presented here demonstrate the importance of the comparative analysis of key regulatory genes in various model systems to fully understand all aspects of plant development.

AB  - FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) has a key role in the timing of the initiation of flowering in Arabidopsis. FLC binds and represses two genes that promote flowering, FT and SOC1. We show that FLC binds to many other genes, indicating that it has regulatory roles other than the repression of flowering. We identified 505 FLC binding sites, mostly located in the promoter regions of genes and containing at least one CArG box, the motif known to be associated with MADS-box proteins such as FLC. We examined 40 of the target genes, and 20 showed increased transcript levels in an flc mutant compared with the wild type. Five genes showed decreased expression in the mutant, indicating that FLC binding can result in either transcriptional repression or activation. The genes we identified as FLC targets are involved in developmental pathways throughout the life history of the plant, many of which are associated with reproductive development. FLC is also involved in vegetative development, as evidenced by its binding to SPL15, delaying the progression from juvenile to adult phase. Some of the FLC target genes are also bound by two other MADS-box proteins, AP1 and SEP3, suggesting that MADS-box genes may operate in a network of control at different stages of the life cycle, many ultimately contributing to the development of the reproductive phase of the plant.

AB  - Edamame is a type of green, vegetable soybean and improving shoot architecture traits for edamame is important for breeding of high-yield varieties by decreasing potential loss due to harvesting. In this study, we use digital imaging technology and computer vision algorithms to characterize major traits of shoot architecture for edamame. Using a population of edamame PIs, we seek to identify underlying genetic control of different shoot architecture traits. We found significant variations in the shoot architecture of the edamame lines including long-skinny and candle stick-like structures. To quantify the similarity and differences of branching patterns between these edamame varieties, we applied a topological measurement called persistent homology. Persistent homology uses algebraic geometry algorithms to measure the structural similarities between complex shapes. We found intriguing relationships between the topological features of branching networks and pod numbers in our plant population, suggesting combination of multiple topological features contribute to the overall pod numbers on a plant. We also identified potential candidate genes including a lateral organ boundary gene family protein and a MADS-box gene that are associated with the pod numbers. This research provides insight into the genetic regulation of shoot architecture traits and can be used to further develop edamame varieties that are better adapted to mechanical harvesting.

AB  - Upon fertilization, the ovary increases in size and undergoes a complex developmental process to become a fruit. We show that cytokinins (CKs), which are required to determine ovary size before fertilization, have to be degraded to facilitate fruit growth. The expression of CKX7, which encodes a cytosolic CK-degrading enzyme, is directly positively regulated post-fertilization by the MADS-box transcription factor STK. Similar to stk, two ckx7 mutants possess shorter fruits than wild type. Quantification of CKs reveals that stk and ckx7 mutants have high CK levels, which negatively control cell expansion during fruit development, compromising fruit growth. Overexpression of CKX7 partially complements the stk fruit phenotype, confirming a role for CK degradation in fruit development. Finally, we show that STK is required for the expression of FUL, which is essential for valve elongation. Overall, we provide insights into the link between CKs and molecular pathways that control fruit growth.

AB  - The MADS-domain transcription factor SEEDSTICK (STK) controls several aspects of plant reproduction. STK is co-expressed with CESTA (CES), a basic Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) transcription factor-encoding gene. CES was reported to control redundantly with the brassinosteroid positive signaling factors BRASSINOSTEROID ENHANCED EXPRESSION1 (BEE1) and BEE3 the development of the transmitting tract. Combining the stk ces-4 mutants led to a reduction in ovule fertilization due to a defect in carpel fusion which, caused the formation of holes at the center of the septum where the transmitting tract differentiates. Combining the stk mutant with the bee1 bee3 ces-4 triple mutant showed an increased number of unfertilized ovules and septum defects. The transcriptome profile of this quadruple mutant revealed a small subset of differentially expressed genes which are mainly involved in cell death, extracellular matrix and cell wall development. Our data evidence a regulatory gene network controlling transmitting tract development regulated directly or indirectly by a STK-CES containing complex and reveal new insights in the regulation of transmitting tract development by bHLH and MADS-domain transcription factors.

AB  - Cell wall modifications are of pivotal importance during plant development. Among cell wall components, xyloglucans are the major hemicellulose polysaccharide in primary cell walls of dicots and non-graminaceous monocots. They can connect the cellulose microfibril surface to affect cell wall mechanical properties. Changes in xyloglucan structure are known to play an important role in regulating cell growth. Therefore, the degradation of xyloglucan is an important modification that alters the cell wall. The alpha-XYLOSIDASE1 (XYL1) gene encodes the only alpha-xylosidase acting on xyloglucans in Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we showed that mutation of XYL1 strongly influences seed size, seed germination, and fruit elongation. We found that the expression of XYL1 is directly regulated in developing seeds and fruit by the MADS-box transcription factor SEEDSTICK. We demonstrated that XYL1 complements the stk smaller seed phenotype. Finally, by atomic force microscopy, we investigated the role of XYL1 activity in maintaining cell stiffness and growth, confirming the importance of cell wall modulation in shaping organs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vegetative buds provide plants in temperate environments the possibility for growth and reproduction when environmental conditions are favorable. In grapevine, crucial developmental events take place within buds during two growing seasons in consecutive years. The first season, the shoot apical meristem within the bud differentiates all the basic elements of the shoot including flowering transition in lateral primordia and development of inflorescence primordia. These events practically end with bud dormancy. The second season, buds resume shoot growth associated to flower formation and development. Gene expression has been previously monitored at specific stages of bud development but has never been followed along the two growing seasons. RESULTS: Gene expression changes were analyzed along the bud annual cycle at eight different time points. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) revealed that the main factors explaining the global gene expression differences were the processes of bud dormancy and active growth as well as stress responses. Accordingly, non dormant buds showed an enrichment in functional categories typical of actively proliferating and growing cells together with the over abundance of transcripts belonging to stress response pathways. Differential expression analyses performed between consecutive time points indicated that major transcriptional changes were associated to para/endodormancy, endo/ecodormancy and ecodormancy/bud break transitions. Transcripts encoding key regulators of reproductive development were grouped in three major expression clusters corresponding to: (i) transcripts associated to flowering induction, (ii) transcripts associated to flower meristem specification and initiation and (iii) transcripts putatively involved in dormancy. Within this cluster, a MADS-box gene (VvFLC2) and other transcripts with similar expression patterns could participate in dormancy regulation. CONCLUSIONS: This work provides a global view of major transcriptional changes taking place along bud development in grapevine, highlighting those molecular and biological functions involved in the main events of bud development. As reported in other woody species, the results suggest that genes regulating flowering could also be involved in dormancy regulatory pathways in grapevine (grapes).

AB  - Leaf size is a major determinant of plant photosynthetic activity and biomass; however, it is poorly understood how leaf size is genetically controlled in cereal crop plants like barley (Hordeum vulgare). We conducted a genome-wide association scan for flowering time, leaf width, and leaf length in a diverse panel of European winter cultivars grown in the field and genotyped with a single-nucleotide polymorphism array. The genome-wide association scan identified PHOTOPERIOD-H1 (Ppd-H1) as a candidate gene underlying the major quantitative trait loci for flowering time and leaf size in the barley population. Microscopic phenotyping of three independent introgression lines confirmed the effect of Ppd-H1 on leaf size. Differences in the duration of leaf growth and consequent variation in leaf cell number were responsible for the leaf size differences between the Ppd-H1 variants. The Ppd-H1-dependent induction of the BARLEY MADS BOX genes BM3 and BM8 in the leaf correlated with reductions in leaf size and leaf number. Our results indicate that leaf size is controlled by the Ppd-H1- and photoperiod-dependent progression of plant development. The coordination of leaf growth with flowering may be part of a reproductive strategy to optimize resource allocation to the developing inflorescences and seeds.

AB  - SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS1 (SOC1) encodes a MADS-box protein that plays an essential role in integrating multiple flowering signals to regulate the transition from vegetative to reproductive development in the model plant Arabidopsis. Although SOC1-like genes have been isolated in various angiosperms, its orthologs in Orchidaceae, one of the largest families of flowering plants, are so far unknown. To investigate the regulatory mechanisms of flowering time control in orchids, we isolated a SOC1-like gene, DOSOC1, from Dendrobium Chao Praya Smile. DOSOC1 was highly expressed in reproductive organs, including inflorescence apices, pedicels, floral buds and open flowers. Its expression significantly increased in whole plantlets during the transition from vegetative to reproductive development, which usually occurred after 8 weeks of culture in Dendrobium Chao Praya Smile. In the shoot apex at the floral transitional stage, DOSOC1 was particularly expressed in emerging floral meristems. Overexpression of DOSOC1 in wild-type Arabidopsis plants resulted in early flowering, which was coupled with the up-regulation of two other flowering promoters, AGAMOUS-LIKE 24 and LEAFY. In addition, overexpression of DOSOC1 was able partially to complement the late-flowering phenotype of Arabidopsis soc1-2 loss-of-function mutants. Furthermore, we successfully created seven 35S:DOSOC1 transgenic Dendrobium orchid lines, which consistently exhibited earlier flowering than wild-type orchids. Our results suggest that SOC1-like genes play an evolutionarily conserved role in promoting flowering in the Orchidaceae family, and that DOSOC1 isolated from Dendrobium Chao Praya Smile could serve as an important target for genetic manipulation of flowering time in orchids.

AB  - Allelic differences at the VRN1 (AP1/CAL/FRU), VRN2 (ZCCT) and VRN3 (FT) vernalization genes affect flowering time in wheat. The two maintained vegetative phase (mvp) mutants from Triticum monococcum L., previously reported as carrying a single gene (VRN1) deletion, are incapable of flowering. In this study, we show that both mvp lines have larger deletions that include the genes AGLG1, CYS, PHYC, VRN1 and possibly others. The original mvp deletions were generated in lines that lack the VRN2 gene. Therefore, to study the effect of the mvp deletions on the regulation of VRN2 we generated populations segregating for both genes simultaneously. The two mvp deletions co-segregated with the non-flowering phenotype, but surprisingly, the lines homozygous for the mvp mutations showed reduced transcript levels of both VRN2 and FT relative to the wild type. The VRN1 deletion is an unlikely cause of the down-regulation of VRN2 since VRN2 transcript levels are higher in the fall, before VRN1 is expressed, and are down-regulated by VRN1. Since both VRN2 and FT are regulated by light and photoperiod, their down-regulation in the mvp mutants might be related to the deletion of the PHYC photoreceptor. However, alternative hypotheses including combinations of other genes deleted in the mvp mutants cannot be ruled out. Until the specific gene(s) responsible for the down-regulation of VRN2 and FT and the non-flowering phenotype are precisely identified, it is premature to use these results to postulate alternative flowering models.

AB  - The ABC model of flower organ identity is widely recognized as providing a framework for understanding the specification of flower organs in diverse plant species. Recent studies in Arabidopsis thaliana have shown that three closely related MADS-box genes, SEPALLATA1 (SEP1), SEP2 and SEP3, are required to specify petals, stamens, and carpels because these organs are converted into sepals in sep1 sep2 sep3 triple mutants. Additional studies indicate that the SEP proteins form multimeric complexes with the products of the B and C organ identity genes. Here, we characterize the SEP4 gene, which shares extensive sequence similarity to and an overlapping expression pattern with the other SEP genes. Although sep4 single mutants display a phenotype similar to that of wild-type plants, we find that floral organs are converted into leaf-like organs in sep1 sep2 sep3 sep4 quadruple mutants, indicating the involvement of all four SEP genes in the development of sepals. We also find that SEP4 contributes to the development of petals, stamens, and carpels in addition to sepals and that it plays an important role in meristem identity. These and other data demonstrate that the SEP genes play central roles in flower meristem identity and organ identity.

AB  - Flowering time (in rice, termed the heading date), plant height, and grain number are crucial agronomic traits for rice productivity. The heading date is controlled via environmental factors (day length and temperature) and genetic factors (floral genes). TERMINAL FLOWER 1 (TFL1) encodes a protein that controls meristem identity and participates in regulating flowering. In this study, a transgenic approach was used to promote the heading date in rice. We isolated and cloned apple (Mallus domesticus) MdTFL1 for early flowering in rice. Transgenic rice plants with antisense MdTFL1 showed an early heading date compared with wild-type plants. A gene expression analysis suggested that introducing MdTFL1 upregulated multiple endogenous floral meristem identity genes, including the (early) heading date gene family FLOWERING LOCUS T and MADS-box transcription factors, thereby shortening vegetable development. Antisense MdTFL1 also produced a wide range of phenotypic changes, including a change in overall plant organelles that affected an array of traits, especially grain productivity. The transgenic rice exhibited a semi-draft phenotype, increased leaf inclination angle, restricted flag leaf length, reduced spikelet fertility, and fewer grains per panicle. MdTFL1 plays a central role in regulating flowering and in various physiological aspects. These findings emphasize the role of TFL1 in regulating flowering in shortened breeding and expanding its function to produce plants with semi-draft phenotypes.

AB  - MADS-box genes encode a highly conserved gene family of transcriptional factors that regulate numerous developmental processes in plants. In this study, a tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) MADS-box gene, SlMADS1, was cloned and its tissue-specific expression profile was analyzed. The real-time polymerase chain reaction results showed that SlMADS1 was highly expressed in sepals and fruits; its expression level was increased with the development of sepals, while the transcript of SlMADS1 decreased significantly in accordance with fruit ripening. To further explore the function of SlMADS1, an RNA interference (RNAi) expression vector targeting SlMADS1 was constructed and transformed into tomato plants. Shorter ripening time of fruit was observed in SlMADS1-silenced tomatoes. The accumulation of carotenoid and the expression of PHYTOENE SYNTHETASE1 were enhanced in RNAi fruits. Besides, ethylene biosynthetic genes, including 1-AMINOCYCLOPROPANE-1-CARBOXYLATE SYNTHASE1A, 1-AMINOCYCLOPROPANE-1-CARBOXYLATE SYNTHASE6, 1-AMINOCYCLOPROPANE-1-CARBOXYLATE OXIDASE1, and 1-AMINOCYCLOPROPANE-1-CARBOXYLATE OXIDASE3, and the ethylene-responsive genes E4 and E8, which were involved in fruit ripening, were also up-regulated in silenced plants. SlMADS1 RNAi fruits showed approximately 2- to 4-fold increases in ethylene production compared with the wild type. Furthermore, SlMADS1-silenced seedlings displayed shorter hypocotyls and were more sensitive to 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate than the wild type. Additionally, a yeast two-hybrid assay revealed a clear interaction between SlMADS1 and SlMADS-RIN. These results suggest that SlMADS1 plays an important role in fruit ripening as a repressive modulator.

AB  - Sweet potato is an important plant for researchers to study storage root development and resistance. MADS‐box proteins are a group of important transcription factors which play a crucial role in plant development as well as stress response. However, the investigation regarding sweet potato MADS‐box genes remains limited up to now. In this study, nine MADS‐box genes, named as IbMBP1˜IbMBP9, were cloned and characterized. Nine genes exhibited different tissue‐specific expression profiles. IbMBP2, IbMBP3, IbMBP4 and IbMBP9 showed high expression during storage roots development and were upregulated by storage roots development‐related hormones. Varying degrees of induction was observed in the transcript level of these MADS‐box genes under multiple abiotic stresses, as well as stress‐related hormones. The present results revealed that nine MADS‐box genes exhibited different tissue‐specific expression profiles and were impacted by multiple abiotic stresses and/or hormones, which lay a good foundation for further exploring the function of MADS‐box genes in sweet potato.

AB  - Flowering transition is tightly coordinated by complex gene regulatory networks, in which AGAMOUS-LIKE 16 (AGL16) plays important roles. Here, we identified the molecular function and binding properties of AGL16 and demonstrated its partial dependency on the SUPPRESSOR OF CONSTANS 1 (SOC1) function in regulating flowering. AGL16 bound to promoters of more than 2,000 genes via CArG-box motifs with high similarity to that of SOC1 in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Approximately 70 flowering genes involved in multiple pathways were potential targets of AGL16. AGL16 formed a protein complex with SOC1 and shared a common set of targets. Intriguingly, only a limited number of genes were differentially expressed in the agl16-1 loss-of-function mutant. However, in the soc1-2 knockout background, AGL16 repressed and activated the expression of 375 and 182 genes, respectively, with more than a quarter bound by AGL16. Corroborating these findings, AGL16 repressed the flowering time more strongly in soc1-2 than in the Col-0 background. These data identify a partial inter-dependency between AGL16 and SOC1 in regulating genome-wide gene expression and flowering time, while AGL16 provides a feedback regulation on SOC1 expression. Our study sheds light on the complex background dependency of AGL16 in flowering regulation, thus providing additional insights into the molecular coordination of development and environmental adaptation.

AB  - The floral transition is the switch from vegetative development to flowering. Proper timing of the floral transition is regulated by different pathways and is critical for the reproductive success of plants. Some of the flowering pathways are controlled by environmental signals such as photoperiod and vernalization, others by autonomous signals such as the developmental state of the plant and hormones, particularly gibberellin. SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CO 1 (SOC1) acts in Arabidopsis as an integrative centre of these pathways, promoting the floral transition. In this work, we show that AGAMOUS-LIKE 42 (AGL42), AGAMOUS-LIKE 71 (AGL71) and AGAMOUS-LIKE 72 (AGL72), which encode MADS-box transcription factors phylogenetically closely related to SOC1, are also involved in the floral transition. They promote flowering at the shoot apical and axillary meristems and seem to act through a gibberellin-dependent pathway. Furthermore SOC1 directly controls the expression of AGL42, AGL71 and AGL72 to balance the expression level of these SOC1-like genes. Our data reveal roles for AGL42, AGL71 and AGL72 in the floral transition, demonstrate their genetic interactions with SOC1 and suggest that their roles differ in the apical and axillary meristems.

AB  - SEPALLATA transcription factors (SEP TFs) have been extensively studied in angiosperms as pivotal components of virtually all the MADS-box tetrameric complex master regulators of floral organ identities. However, there are published reports that suggest that some SEP members also regulate earlier reproductive events, such as inflorescence meristem determinacy and inflorescence architecture, with potential for application in breeding programs in crops. The SEP subfamily underwent a quite complex pattern of duplications during the radiation of the angiosperms. Taking advantage of the many whole genomic sequences now available, we present a revised and expanded SEP phylogeny and link it to the known functions of previously characterized genes. This snapshot supports the evidence that the major SEP3 clade is highly specialized for the specification of the three innermost floral whorls, while its sister LOFSEP clade is functionally more versatile and has been recruited for diverse roles, such as the regulation of extra-floral bract formation and inflorescence determinacy and shape. This larger pool of angiosperm SEP genes confirms previous evidence that their evolution was driven by whole-genome duplications rather than small-scale duplication events. Our work may help to identify those SEP lineages that are the best candidates for the improvement of inflorescence traits, even in far distantly related crops.

AB  - Genes that control ovule identity were first identified in Petunia. Co-suppression of both FLORAL BINDING PROTEIN 7 (FBP7) and FBP11, two D-lineage genes, resulted in the homeotic transformation of ovules into carpelloid structures. Later in Arabidopsis it was shown that three genes, SHATTERPROOF1 (SHP1), SHP2, and SEEDSTICK (STK), redundantly control ovule identity, because in the stk shp1 shp2 triple mutant ovules lose identity and are transformed into carpel and leaf-like structures. Of these three Arabidopsis genes STK is the only D-lineage gene, and its expression, like FBP7 and FBP11, is restricted to ovules. OsMADS13 is the rice ortholog of STK, FBP7, and FBP11. Its amino acid sequence is similar to the Arabidopsis and Petunia proteins, and its expression is also restricted to ovules. We show that the osmads13 mutant is female sterile and that ovules are converted into carpelloid structures. Furthermore, making carpels inside carpels, the osmads13 flower is indeterminate, showing that OsMADS13 also has a function in floral meristem determinacy. OsMADS21 is most likely to be a paralog of OsMADS13, although its expression is not restricted to ovules. Interestingly, the osmads21 mutant did not show any obvious phenotype. Furthermore, combining the osmads13 and the osmads21 mutants did not result in any additive ovule defect, indicating that osmads21 does not control ovule identity. These results suggest that during evolution the D-lineage gene OsMADS21 has lost its ability to determine ovule identity.

AB  - AGL6 is an ancient subfamily of MADS-box genes found in both gymnosperms and angiosperms. Its functions remained elusive despite the fact that the MADS-box genes and the ABC model have been studied for >20 years. Nevertheless, recent discoveries in petunia, rice, and maize support its involvement in the 'E' function of floral development, very similar to the closely related AGL2 (SEPALLATA) subfamily which has been well characterized. The known functions of AGL6 span from ancient conserved roles to new functions acquired in specific plant families. The AGL6 genes are involved in floral meristem regulation, in floral organs, and ovule (integument) and seed development, and have possible roles in both male and female germline and gametophyte development. In grasses, they are also important for the development of the first whorl of the flower, whereas in Arabidopsis they may play additional roles before floral meristem formation. This review covers these recent insights and some other aspects that are not yet fully elucidated, which deserve more studies in the future.

AB  - Plant meristems are self-renewing groups of pluripotent stem cells that produce lateral organs in a stereotypical pattern. Of interest is how the radially symmetrical meristem produces laminar lateral organs. Both the male and female inflorescence meristems of the dominant Fascicled ear (Fas1) mutant fail to grow as a single point and instead show deep branching. Positional cloning of two independent Fas1 alleles identified an approximately 160 kb region containing two floral genes, the MADS-box gene, zmm8, and the YABBY gene, drooping leaf2 (drl2). Both genes are duplicated within the Fas1 locus and spatiotemporally misexpressed in the mutant inflorescence meristems. Increased zmm8 expression alone does not affect inflorescence development; however, combined misexpression of zmm8, drl2, and their syntenic paralogs zmm14 and drl1, perturbs meristem organization. We hypothesize that misexpression of the floral genes in the inflorescence and their potential interaction cause ectopic activation of a laminar program, thereby disrupting signaling necessary for maintenance of radially symmetrical inflorescence meristems. Consistent with this hypothesis, RNA sequencing and in situ analysis reveal altered expression patterns of genes that define distinct zones of the meristem and developing leaf. Our findings highlight the importance of strict spatiotemporal patterns of expression for both zmm8 and drl2 and provide an example of phenotypes arising from tandem gene duplications.

AB  - The MADS-box transcription factor-encoding genes are expressed mainly during plant reproductive development, where they play important roles in controlling floral organ initiation and identity. Few previous reports have investigated the functions of MADS-box transcription factors expressed in vegetative tissues. Here we describe the functional characterization of a rice AG-like MADS-box protein, OsMDP1 (Oryza sativa MADS-domain-containing protein 1). A partial cDNA encoding a MADS-box domain was identified via high-throughput screening of rice brassinolide-regulated genes, and the full-length cDNA was subsequently isolated via screening of a cDNA library constructed from rice materials at tillering stage. Expression pattern analyses indicated that OsMDP1 is transcribed mainly in vegetative tissues, including the mature leaf, coleoptile, root-elongation zone, culm internode, and especially the joint region between the leaf blade and sheath. Further studies revealed that transcription of OsMDP1 is stimulated by darkness and suppressed by brassinolide treatment. OsMDP1 deficiency resulted in shortened primary roots, elongated coleoptiles and enhanced lamina joint inclinations. Moreover, transgenic plants showed hypersensitivities to exogenous brassinolide in terms of lamina joint inclination and coleoptile elongation. OsMDP1 deficiency resulted in enhanced expression of OsXTR1, which encodes xyloglucan endotransglycosylase, the cell-wall loosening enzyme necessary for cell elongation, and modulated expressions of multiple genes involved in cell signalling and gene transcription, indicating the key negative regulatory role of OsMDP1 in BR signalling.

AB  - In Antirrhinum, floral meristems are established by meristem identity genes. Floral meristems give rise to floral organs in whorls, with their identity established by combinatorial activities of organ identity genes. Double mutants of the floral meristem identity gene SQUAMOSA and organ identity genes DEFICIENS or GLOBOSA produce flowers in which whorled patterning is partially lost. In yeast, SQUA, DEF and GLO proteins form ternary complexes via their C-termini, which in gel-shift assays show increased DNA binding to CArG motifs compared with DEF/GLO heterodimers or SQUA/SQUA homodimers. Formation of ternary complexes by plant MADS-box factors increases the complexity of their regulatory functions and might be the molecular basis for establishment of whorled phyllotaxis and combinatorial interactions of floral organ identity genes.

AB  - Seed formation is a pivotal process in plant reproduction and dispersal. It begins with megagametophyte development in the ovule, followed by fertilization and subsequently coordinated development of embryo, endosperm, and maternal seed coat. Two closely related MADS-box genes, SHATTERPROOF 1 and 2 (SHP1 and SHP2) are involved in specifying ovule integument identity in Arabidopsis thaliana. The MADS box gene ARABIDOPSIS BSISTER (ABS or TT16) is required, together with SEEDSTICK (STK) for the formation of endothelium, part of the seed coat and innermost tissue layer formed by the maternal plant. Little is known about the genetic interaction of SHP1 and SHP2 with ABS and the coordination of endosperm and seed coat development. In this work, mutant and expression analysis shed light on this aspect of concerted development. Triple tt16 shp1 shp2 mutants produce malformed seedlings, seed coat formation defects, fewer seeds, and mucilage reduction. While shp1 shp2 mutants fail to coordinate the timely development of ovules, tt16 mutants show less peripheral endosperm after fertilization. Failure in coordinated division of the innermost integument layer in early ovule stages leads to inner seed coat defects in tt16 and tt16 shp1 shp2 triple mutant seeds. An antagonistic action of ABS and SHP1/SHP2 is observed in inner seed coat layer formation. Expression analysis also indicates that ABS represses SHP1, SHP2, and FRUITFUL expression. Our work shows that the evolutionary conserved Bsister genes are required not only for endothelium but also for endosperm development and genetically interact with SHP1 and SHP2 in a partially antagonistic manner.

AB  - Six MaMADS-box genes have been cloned from the banana fruit cultivar Grand Nain. The similarity of these genes to tomato LeRIN is low and neither MaMADS2 nor MaMADS1 complement the tomato rin mutation. Nevertheless, the expression patterns, specifically in fruit and the induction during ripening and in response to ethylene and 1-MCP, suggest that some of these genes may participate in ripening. MaMADS1, 2, and 3, are highly expressed in fruit only, while the others are expressed in fruit as well as in other organs. Moreover, the suites of MaMADS-box genes and their temporal expression differ in peel and pulp during ripening. In the pulp, the increase in MaMADS2, 3, 4, and 5 expression preceded an increase in ethylene production, but coincides with the CO(2) peak. However, MaMADS1 expression in pulp coincided with ethylene production, but a massive increase in its expression occurred late during ripening, together with a second wave in the expression of MaMADS2, 3, and 4. In the peel, on the other hand, an increase in expression of MaMADS1, 3, and to a lesser degree also of MaMADS4 and 2 coincided with an increase in ethylene production. Except MaMADS3, which was induced by ethylene in pulp and peel, only MaMADS4, and 5 in pulp and MaMADS1 in peel were induced by ethylene. 1-MCP applied at the onset of the increase in ethylene production, increased the levels of MaMADS4 and MaMADS1 in pulp, while it decreased MaMADS1, 3, 4, and 5 in peel, suggesting that MaMADS4 and MaMADS1 are negatively controlled by ethylene at the onset of ethylene production only in pulp. Only MaMADS2 is neither induced by ethylene nor by 1-MCP, and it is expressed mainly in pulp. Our results suggest that two independent ripening programs are employed in pulp and peel which involve the activation of mainly MaMADS2, 4, and 5 and later on also MaMADS1 in pulp, and mainly MaMADS1, and 3 in peel. Hence, our results are consistent with MaMADS2, a SEP3 homologue, acting in the pulp upstream of the increase in ethylene production similarly to LeMADS-RIN.

AB  - Despite intensive research on genetic regulation of flower development there are still only a few studies on the early phases of this process in perennial plants like trees. The aim of this study has been to identify genes that regulate early stages of inflorescence development in silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) and to follow the expression of these genes during development of the unisexual birch inflorescences. Here we describe the cloning and characterization of 3 cDNAs representing MADS-box genes designated BpMADS3, BpMADS4 and BpMADS5, all belonging to the AP1/SQUA group of plant MADS-box genes. According to RNA blot analysis, all 3 genes are active during the development of both male and female inflorescences. However, differences in patterns of expression suggest that they play different roles. BpMADS3 is most similar in sequence to AP1 and SQUA, but it seems to have the highest expression at late developmental stages. BpMADS4 is most similar in sequence to the Arabidopsis gene FRUITFULL, but is expressed, in addition to developing inflorescences, in shoots and roots. BpMADS5 is also similar to FRUITFULL; its expression seems to be inflorescence-specific and continues during fruit development. Ectopic expression of either BpMADS3, BpMADS4 or BpMADS5 with the CaMV 35S promoter in tobacco results in extremely early flowering. All of these birch genes seem to act early during the transition to reproductive phase and might be involved in the determination of the identity of the inflorescence or flower meristem. They could apparently be used to accelerate flowering in various plant species.

AB  - MIKC-type MADS domain proteins are key regulators of flower development in angiosperms. B(sister) genes constitute a clade with a close relationship to class B floral homeotic genes, and have been conserved for more than 300 million years. The loss-of-function phenotype of the A. thaliana B(sister) gene ABS is mild: mutants show reduced seed coloration and defects in endothelium development. This study focuses on GORDITA (GOA, formerly known as AGL63), the most closely related paralog of ABS in A. thaliana, which is thought to act redundantly with ABS. Phylogenetic trees reveal that the duplication leading to ABS and GOA occurred during diversification of the Brassicaceae, and further analyses show that GOA has evolved under relaxed selection pressure. The knockdown phenotype of GOA suggests a role for this gene in fruit longitudinal growth, while over-expression of GOA results in disorganized floral structure and addition of carpel-like features to sepals. Given the phylogeny and function of other B(sister) genes, our data suggest that GOA has evolved a new function as compared to ABS. Protein analysis reveals that the GOA-specific 'deviant' domain is required for protein dimerization, in contrast to other MIKC-type proteins that require the K domain for dimerization. Moreover, no shared protein interaction partners for ABS and GOA could be identified. Our experiments indicate that modification of a protein domain and a shift in expression pattern can lead to a novel gene function in a relatively short time, and highlight the molecular mechanism by which neofunctionalization following gene duplication can be achieved.

AB  - Bud dormancy is an adaptive process that allows trees to survive the hard environmental conditions that they experience during the winter of temperate climates. Dormancy is characterized by the reduction in meristematic activity and the absence of visible growth. A prolonged exposure to cold temperatures is required to allow the bud resuming growth in response to warm temperatures. In fruit tree species, the dormancy cycle is believed to be regulated by a group of genes encoding MADS-box transcription factors. These genes are called DORMANCY-ASSOCIATED MADS-BOX (DAM) and are phylogenetically related to the Arabidopsis thaliana floral regulators SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) and AGAMOUS-LIKE 24. The interest in DAM and other orthologs of SVP (SVP-like) genes has notably increased due to the publication of several reports suggesting their role in the control of bud dormancy in numerous fruit species, including apple, pear, peach, Japanese apricot, and kiwifruit among others. In this review, we briefly describe the physiological bases of the dormancy cycle and how it is genetically regulated, with a particular emphasis on DAM and SVP-like genes. We also provide a detailed report of the most recent advances about the transcriptional regulation of these genes by seasonal cues, epigenetics and plant hormones. From this information, we propose a tentative classification of DAM and SVP-like genes based on their seasonal pattern of expression. Furthermore, we discuss the potential biological role of DAM and SVP-like genes in bud dormancy in antagonizing the function of FLOWERING LOCUS T-like genes. Finally, we draw a global picture of the possible role of DAM and SVP-like genes in the bud dormancy cycle and propose a model that integrates these genes in a molecular network of dormancy cycle regulation in temperate fruit trees.

AB  - The MADS family is an ancient and best-studied transcription factor and plays fundamental roles in almost every developmental process in plants. In the plant evolutionary history, the whole genome duplication (WGD) events are important not only to the plant species evolution, but to expansion of members of the gene families. Soybean as a model legume crop has experience three rounds of WGD events. Members of some MIKC(C) subfamilies, such as SOC, AGL6, SQUA, SVP, AGL17 and DEF/GLO, were expanded after soybean three rounds of WGD events. And some MIKC(C) subfamilies, MIKC* and type I MADS families had experienced faster birth-and-death evolution and their traces before the Glycine WGD event were not found. Transposed duplication played important roles in tandem arrangements among the members of different subfamilies. According to the expression profiles of type I and MIKC paralog pair genes, the fates of MIKC paralog gene pairs were subfunctionalization, and the fates of type I MADS paralog gene pairs were nonfunctionalization. 137 out of 163 MADS genes were close to 186 loci within 2 Mb genomic regions associated with seed-relative QTLs, among which 115 genes expressed during the seed development. Although MIKC(C) genes kept the important and conserved functions of the flower development, most MIKC(C) genes showed potentially essential roles in the seed development as well as the type I MADS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The ray and disc florets on the chrysanthemum capitulum are morphologically diverse and have remarkably abundant variant types, resulting in a rich variety of flower types. An anemone shape with pigmented and elongated disk florets is an important trait in flower shape breeding of chrysanthemums. The regulatory mechanism of their anemone-type disc floret formation was not clear, thus limiting the directional breeding of chrysanthemum flower types. In this study, we used morphological observation, transcriptomic analysis, and gene expression to investigate the morphogenetic processes and regulatory mechanisms of anemone-type chrysanthemum. RESULT: Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation showed that morphological differences between non-anemone-type disc florets and anemone-type disc florets occurred mainly during the petal elongation period. The anemone-type disc florets elongated rapidly in the later stages of development. Longitudinal paraffin section analysis revealed that the anemone-type disc florets were formed by a great number of cells in the middle layer of the petals with vigorous division. We investigated the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using ray and disc florets of two chrysanthemum cultivars, 082 and 068, for RNA-Seq and their expression patterns of non-anemone-type and anemone-type disc florets. The result suggested that the CYCLOIDEA2 (CYC2s), MADS-box genes, and phytohormone signal-related genes appeared significantly different in both types of disc florets and might have important effects on the formation of anemone-type disc florets. In addition, it is noteworthy that the auxin and jasmonate signaling pathways might play a vital role in developing anemone-type disc florets. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings, we propose a regulatory network for forming non-anemone-type and anemone-type disc florets. The results of this study lead the way to further clarify the mechanism of the anemone-type chrysanthemum formation and lay the foundation for the directive breeding of chrysanthemum petal types.

AB  - MADS-box genes are involved in floral organ development. Here we report that an AGL6(Agamous-like 6)-like MADS-box gene, HoAGL6, was isolated from Hyacinthus orientalis L. Expression pattern analysis demonstrated that HoAGL6 transcript was detected in inflorescence buds, tepals, carpels and ovules, but not in stamina, leaves or scales. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants ectopically expressing HoAGL6 exhibited novel phenotypes of significantly reduced plant size, extremely early flowering, and losing inflorescence indeterminacy. In addition, wide homeotic conversion of sepals, petals, and leaves into carpel-like or ovary structures, and disappearance or number reduction of stamens in 35S::HoAGL6 Arabidopsis plants were also observed. RT-PCR analysis indicated that the expressions of flowering time gene SOC1 and flower meristem identity gene LFY were significantly up-regulated in 35S::HoAGL6 transgenic Arabidopsis plants, and the expression levels of floral organ identity genes AG and SEP1 in leaves were also elevated. These results indicated that HoAGL6 was involved in the regulation of flower transition and flower organ formation.

AB  - Chinese plum (Prunus salicina Lindl.) is a stone fruit that belongs to the Prunus genus and plays an important role in the global production of plum. In this study, we report the genome sequence of the Chinese plum "Sanyueli", which is known to have a low-chill requirement for flower bud break. The assembled genome size was 282.38 Mb, with a contig N50 of 1.37 Mb. Over 99% of the assembly was anchored to eight pseudochromosomes, with a scaffold N50 of 34.46 Mb. A total of 29,708 protein-coding genes were predicted from the genome and 46.85% (132.32 Mb) of the genome was annotated as repetitive sequence. Bud dormancy is influenced by chilling requirement in plum and partly controlled by DORMANCY ASSOCIATED MADS-box (DAM) genes. Six tandemly arrayed PsDAM genes were identified in the assembled genome. Sequence analysis of PsDAM6 in "Sanyueli" revealed the presence of large insertions in the intron and exon regions. Transcriptome analysis indicated that the expression of PsDAM6 in the dormant flower buds of "Sanyueli" was significantly lower than that in the dormant flower buds of the high chill requiring "Furongli" plum. In addition, PsDAM6 expression was repressed by chilling treatment. The genome sequence of "Sanyueli" plum provides a valuable resource for elucidating the molecular mechanisms responsible for the regulation of chilling requirements, and it is also useful for the identification of the genes involved in the control of other important agronomic traits and molecular breeding in plum.

AB  - Sugarcane is the most important sugar and biofuel crop. MADS-box genes encode transcription factors that are involved in developmental control and signal transduction in plants. Systematic analyses of MADS-box genes have been reported in many plant species, but its identification and characterization were not possible until a reference genome of autotetraploid wild type sugarcane specie, Saccharum spontaneum is available recently. We identified 182 MADS-box sequences in the S. spontaneum genome, which were annotated into 63 genes, including 6 (9.5%) genes with four alleles, 21 (33.3%) with three, 29 (46%) with two, 7 (11.1%) with one allele. Paralogs (tandem duplication and disperse duplicated) were also identified and characterized. These MADS-box genes were divided into two groups; Type-I (21 Malpha, 4 Mbeta, 4 Mgamma) and Type-II (32 MIKCc, 2 MIKC*) through phylogenetic analysis with orthologs in Arabidopsis and sorghum. Structural diversity and distribution of motifs were studied in detail. Chromosomal localizations revealed that S. spontaneum MADS-box genes were randomly distributed across eight homologous chromosome groups. The expression profiles of these MADS-box genes were analyzed in leaves, roots, stem sections and after hormones treatment. Important alleles based on promoter analysis and expression variations were dissected. qRT-PCR analysis was performed to verify the expression pattern of pivotal S. spontaneum MADS-box genes and suggested that flower timing genes (SOC1 and SVP) may regulate vegetative development.

AB  - The AGAMOUS (AG) gene is necessary for stamen and carpel development and is part of a monophyletic clade of MADS-box genes that also includes SHATTERPROOF1 (SHP1), SHP2, and SEEDSTICK (STK). Here, we show that ectopic expression of either the STK or SHP gene is sufficient to induce the transformation of sepals into carpeloid organs bearing ovules. Moreover, the fact that these organ transformations occur when the STK gene is expressed ectopically in ag mutants shows that STK can promote carpel development in the absence of AG activity. We also show that STK, AG, SHP1, and SHP2 can form multimeric complexes and that these interactions require the SEPALLATA (SEP) MADS-box proteins. We provide genetic evidence for this role of the SEP proteins by showing that a reduction in SEP activity leads to the loss of normal ovule development, similar to what occurs in stk shp1 shp2 triple mutants. Together, these results indicate that the SEP proteins, which are known to form multimeric complexes in the control of flower organ identity, also form complexes to control normal ovule development.

AB  - Apomixis is a reproductive model that bypasses sexual reproduction, so it does not require the combination of paternal and maternal gametes but instead results in the production of offspring directly from maternal tissues. This reproductive mode results in the same genetic material in the mother and the offspring and has significant applications in agricultural breeding. Molecular and cytological methods were used to identify the reproductive type of Zanthoxylum bungeanum (ZB). Fluorescence detection of the amplified products of 12 pairs of polymorphic SSR primers showed consistent fluorescence signals for mother and offspring, indicating that no trait separation occurred during reproduction. In addition, the cytological observation results showed differentiation of ZB embryos (2n) from nucellar cells (2n) to form indefinite embryonic primordia and then form adventitious embryos (2n), indicating that the apomictic type of ZB is sporophytic apomixis. The MADS-box transcription factor ZbAGL11 was highly expressed during the critical period of nucellar embryo development in ZB. Unpollinated ZbAGL11-OE Arabidopsis produced fertile offspring and exhibited an apomictic phenotype. The overexpression of ZbAGL11 increased the callus induction rate of ZB tissue. In addition, the results of the yeast two-hybrid experiment showed that ZbAGL11 could interact with the ZbCYP450 and ZbCAD11 proteins. Our results demonstrate that ZbAGL11 can cause developmental disorders of Arabidopsis flower organs and result in apomixis-like phenotypes.

AB  - Starch synthesis makes a dramatic contribution to the yield and nutritional value of cereal crops. Although several starch synthesis enzymes and related regulators have been reported, the underlying regulatory mechanisms of starch synthesis remain largely unknown. OsMADS14 is a FRUITFULL (FUL)-like MADS-box gene in rice (Oryza sativa). Here we show that two null mutations of OsMADS14 result in a shrunken and chalky grain phenotype. It is caused by obviously defective compound starch granules and a significantly reduced content of both total starch and amylose in the endosperm. Transcriptomic profiling analyses revealed that the loss-of-function of OsMADS14 leads to significantly downregulated expression of many core starch synthesis genes, including OsAGPL2 and Waxy. Both in vitro and in vivo assays demonstrate that the OsMADS14 protein directly binds to stretches of DNA with a CArG-box consensus in the putative regulatory regions of OsAGPL2 and Waxy. Protein-protein interaction experiments also suggest that OsMADS14 interacts with nuclear factor NF-YB1 to promote the transcription of OsAGPL2 and Waxy. Our study thus demonstrates that OsMADS14 plays an essential role in the synthesis of storage starch and provides novel insights into the underlying molecular mechanism that may be used to improve rice cultivars by molecular breeding.

AB  - Skin color is a key quality attribute of fruits and how to improve fruit coloration has long been a major concern. 5-Aminolevulinic acid (ALA), a natural plant growth regulator, can significantly increase anthocyanin accumulation in fruit skin and therefore effectively improve coloration of many fruits, including apple. However, the molecular mechanism how ALA stimulates anthocyanin accumulation in fruit skin remains unknown. Here, we investigated the impact of ALA on apple skin at the protein and mRNA levels. A total of 85 differentially expressed proteins in apple skins between ALA and water treatment (control) were identified by complementary gel-based and gel-free separation techniques. Most of these differentially expressed proteins were up-regulated by ALA. Function analysis suggested that 87.06% of the ALA-responsive proteins were associated with fruit ripening. To further screen ALA-responsive regulators, we constructed a subtracted cDNA library (tester: ALA treatment; driver: control) and obtained 104 differentially expressed unigenes, of which 38 unigenes were indicators for the fruit ripening-related genes. The differentially changed proteins and transcripts did not correspond well at an individual level, but showed similar regulated direction in function at the pathway level. Among the identified fruit ripening-related genes, the expression of MdMADS1, a developmental transcription regulator of fruit ripening, was positively correlated with expression of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes (MdCHS, MdDFR, MdLDOX, and MdUFGT) in apple skin under ALA treatment. Moreover, overexpression of MdMADS1 enhanced anthocyanin content in transformed apple calli, which was further enhanced by ALA. The anthocyanin content in MdMADS1-silenced calli was less than that in the control with ALA treatment, but higher than that without ALA treatment. These results indicated that MdMADS1 is involved in ALA-induced anthocyanin accumulation. In addition, anthocyanin-related verification in apple calli suggested that the regulation of MdMADS1 on anthocyanin biosynthesis was partially independent of fruit ripening process. Taken together, our findings provide insight into the mechanism how ALA regulates anthocyanin accumulation and add new information on transcriptase regulators of fruit coloration.

AB  - The naturally occurring bisexual cone of gymnosperms has long been considered a possible intermediate stage in the origin of flowers, but the mechanisms governing bisexual cone formation remain largely elusive. Here, we employed transcriptomic and DNA methylomic analyses, together with hormone measurement, to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying bisexual cone development in the conifer Picea crassifolia. Our study reveals a "bisexual" expression profile in bisexual cones, especially in expression patterns of B-class, C-class and LEAFY genes, supporting the out of male model. GGM7 could be essential for initiating bisexual cones. DNA methylation reconfiguration in bisexual cones affects the expression of key genes in cone development, including PcDAL12, PcDAL10, PcNEEDLY, and PcHDG5. Auxin likely plays an important role in the development of female structures of bisexual cones. This study unveils the potential mechanisms responsible for bisexual cone formation in conifers and may shed light on the evolution of bisexuality.

AB  - Multiple factors, including the MADS-domain proteins AGAMOUS-LIKE15 (AGL15) and AGL18, contribute to the regulation of the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth. AGL15 and AGL18 were previously shown to act redundantly as floral repressors and upstream of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). A series of genetic and molecular experiments, primarily focused on AGL15, was performed to more clearly define their role. agl15 agl18 mutations fail to suppress ft mutations but show additive interactions with short vegetative phase (svp) mutations in ft and suppressor of constans1 (soc1) backgrounds. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses with AGL15-specific antibodies indicate that AGL15 binds directly to the FT locus at sites that partially overlap those bound by SVP and FLOWERING LOCUS C. In addition, expression of AGL15 in the phloem effectively restores wild-type flowering times in agl15 agl18 mutants. When agl15 agl18 mutations are combined with agl24 svp mutations, the plants show upward curling of rosette and cauline leaves, in addition to early flowering. The change in leaf morphology is associated with elevated levels of FT and ectopic expression of SEPALLATA3 (SEP3), leading to ectopic expression of floral genes. Leaf curling is suppressed by sep3 and ft mutations and enhanced by soc1 mutations. Thus, AGL15 and AGL18, along with SVP and AGL24, are necessary to block initiation of floral programs in vegetative organs.

AB  - Aethionema arabicum is an important model plant for Brassicaceae trait evolution, particularly of seed (development, regulation, germination, dormancy) and fruit (development, dehiscence mechanisms) characters. Its genome assembly was recently improved but the gene annotation was not updated. Here, we improved the Ae. arabicum gene annotation using 294 RNA-seq libraries and 136 307 full-length PacBio Iso-seq transcripts, increasing BUSCO completeness by 11.6% and featuring 5606 additional genes. Analysis of orthologs showed a lower number of genes in Ae. arabicum than in other Brassicaceae, which could be partially explained by loss of homeologs derived from the At-alpha polyploidization event and by a lower occurrence of tandem duplications after divergence of Aethionema from the other Brassicaceae. Benchmarking of MADS-box genes identified orthologs of FUL and AGL79 not found in previous versions. Analysis of full-length transcripts related to ABA-mediated seed dormancy discovered a conserved isoform of PIF6-beta and antisense transcripts in ABI3, ABI4 and DOG1, among other cases found of different alternative splicing between Turkey and Cyprus ecotypes. The presented data allow alternative splicing mining and proposition of numerous hypotheses to research evolution and functional genomics. Annotation data and sequences are available at the Ae. arabicum DB (https://plantcode.online.uni-marburg.de/aetar_db).

AB  - The ABC model, which was accepted for almost a decade as a paradigm for flower development in angiosperms, has been subjected recently to a significant modification with the introduction of the new class of E-function genes. This function is required for the proper action of the B- and C-class homeotic proteins and is provided in Arabidopsis by the SEPALLATA1/2/3 MADS box transcription factors. A triple mutant in these partially redundant genes displays homeotic conversion of petals, stamens, and carpels into sepaloid organs and loss of determinacy in the center of the flower. A similar phenotype was obtained by cosuppression of the MADS box gene FBP2 in petunia. Here, we provide evidence that this phenotype is caused by the downregulation of both FBP2 and the paralog FBP5. Functional complementation of the sepallata mutant by FBP2 and our finding that the FBP2 protein forms multimeric complexes with other floral homeotic MADS box proteins indicate that FBP2 represents the same E function as SEP3 in Arabidopsis.

AB  - This work presents a robust analysis of the inositols (INSs) and raffinose family oligosaccharides (RFOs) pathways, using genomic and transcriptomic tools in cowpea under root dehydration. Nineteen (~70%) of the 26 scrutinized enzymes presented transcriptional up-regulation in at least one treatment time. The transcriptional orchestration allowed categorization of the analyzed enzymes as time-independent (those showing the same regulation throughout the assay) and time-dependent (those showing different transcriptional regulation over time). It is suggested that up-regulated time-independent enzymes (INSs: myo-inositol oxygenase, inositol-tetrakisphosphate 1-kinase 3, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase 4-like, 1-phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate 5-kinase, phosphoinositide phospholipase C, and non-specific phospholipase C; RFOs: alpha-galactosidase, invertase, and raffinose synthase) actively participate in the reorganization of cowpea molecular physiology under the applied stress. In turn, time-dependent enzymes, especially those up-regulated in some of the treatment times (INSs: inositol-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase, phosphatidylinositol synthase, multiple inositol polyphosphate phosphatase 1, methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase, triosephosphate isomerase, myo-inositol-3-phosphate synthase, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate 3-phosphatase and protein-tyrosine-phosphatase, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; RFOs: galactinol synthase) seem to participate in fine-tuning of the molecular physiology, helping the cowpea plants to acclimatize under dehydration stress. Not all loci encoding the studied enzymes were expressed during the assay; most of the expressed ones exhibited a variable transcriptional profile in the different treatment times. Genes of the INSs and RFOs pathways showed high orthology with analyzed Phaseoleae members, suggesting a relevant role within this legume group. Regarding the promoter regions of INSs and RFOs genes, some bona fide cis-regulatory elements were identified in association with seven transcription factor families (AP2-EFR, Dof-type, MADS-box, bZIP, CPP, ZF-HD, and GATA-type). Members of INSs and RFOs pathways potentially participate in other processes regulated by these proteins in cowpea.

AB  - In flowering plants, seed development is initiated by the fusion of the maternal egg and central cells with two paternal sperm cells, leading to the formation of embryo and endosperm, respectively. The fertilization products are surrounded by the maternally derived seed coat, whose development prior to fertilization is blocked by epigenetic regulators belonging to the Polycomb Group (PcG) protein family. Here we show that fertilization of the central cell results in the production of auxin and most likely its export to the maternal tissues, which drives seed coat development by removing PcG function. We furthermore show that mutants for the MADS-box transcription factor AGL62 have an impaired transport of auxin from the endosperm to the integuments, which results in seed abortion. We propose that AGL62 regulates auxin transport from the endosperm to the integuments, leading to the removal of the PcG block on seed coat development.

AB  - In flowering plants, seed development is preceded by a double fertilization event, whereby two male sperm cells fuse with two female gametes: the egg and central cells. The fertilized egg cell will form the embryo, and the fertilized central cell will give rise to the triploid endosperm, whose function is to nourish and support the embryo. Even though the endosperm has an unparalleled role for human nutrition, the molecular bases for its development are yet to be understood. Our results reveal that increasing auxin levels after fertilization drive the replication of the central cell in Arabidopsis thaliana. Auxin is sufficient to trigger central cell division and is necessary for correct endosperm development, a process dependent on the MADS-box transcription factor AGL62 (AGAMOUS-LIKE 62). We propose that the epigenetic regulators of the Polycomb group (PcG) family block central cell division before fertilization by repressing the expression of auxin biosynthesis genes in the female gametophyte.

AB  - The seed, the reproductive unit of angiosperms, is generally protected by the seed coat. The seed coat is made of one or two integuments, each comprising two epidermal cells layers and, in some cases, extra sub-epidermal cell layers. The thickness of the seed-coat affects several aspects of seed biology such as dormancy, germination and mortality. In Arabidopsis, the inner integument displays one or two sub-epidermal cell layers that originate from periclinal cell divisions of the innermost epidermal cell layer. By contrast, the outer integument was considered to be two-cell layered. Here, we show that sub-epidermal chalazal cells grow in between the epidermal outer integument cell layers to create an incomplete three-cell layered outer integument. We found that the MADS box transcription factor TRANSPARENT TESTA 16 represses growth of the chalaza and formation of sub-epidermal outer integument cells. Finally, we demonstrate that sub-epidermal cells of the outer and inner integument respond differently to the repressive mechanism mediated by FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT SEED Polycomb group proteins and to fertilization signals. Our data suggest that integument cell origin rather than sub-epidermal cell position underlies different responses to fertilization.

AB  - Several members of the MADS-box gene family have been shown to be important regulators of flower development, controlling such well-studied early events as the formation of the floral meristem and the specification of floral organ identity. Other floral-specific MADS-box genes, of as yet unknown function, have been isolated by homology and are proposed to be part of a regulatory hierarchy controlling flower development. Some of these genes might regulate later aspects of flower development, such as development of individual floral organs, which is less well studied at the molecular level. This paper presents a detailed analysis of the expression pattern of one such gene from Arabidopsis, AGL1, using RNA in situ hybridization. It is found that AGL1 is specifically expressed in particular regions of the gynoecium and ovule, only during and after floral development stage 7. AGL1 expression at the tip of the growing carpel primordia, along the margins of the ovary valves in developing and mature gynoecia and in specific regions of developing and mature ovules provides important insights into the possible roles of AGL1. It is proposed that AGL1 may have regulatory functions in the structural definition and/or function of the valve margins, in axis maintenance during ovule development, in nutritional supply to the growing ovule and embryo sac, and in pollen tube guidance. In the floral homeotic mutants ag-1, ap3-3 and ap2-2, AGL1 mRNA is expressed in an organ-dependent manner, suggesting that AGL1 is a carpel-specific gene and as such ultimately depends upon the carpel identity gene AG for proper gene expression.

AB  - AGL2 is one of several Arabidopsis floral MADS-box genes that were isolated based on sequence similarity to the homeotic gene AGAMOUS. To investigate its possible role in flower development, we have characterized in detail the expression pattern of AGL2 in both wild-type and mutant flowers using RNA in situ hybridization. We find that AGL2 is floral-specific; it is not expressed in the inflorescence meristem. Within the floral meristem, AGL2 is first expressed very early in development, after the floral meristem has emerged from the inflorescence meristem but before any of the organ primordia emerge. The AGL2 transcript is very abundant and uniform throughout the floral meristem and in the primordia of all four floral organs: sepals, petals, stamens and carpels. Thus, AGL2 represents a new class of MADS-box genes which is expressed in all four whorls of the flower. The AGL2 transcript remains abundant in each organ during morphological differentiation, but diminishes as each organ undergoes the final maturation phase of development. AGL2 expression is high in developing ovules and, after fertilization, in developing embryos and seed coats, abating as seeds mature. In the floral organ identity mutants ag-1, ap3-3 and ap2-2, the AGL2 expression pattern is organ- and stage-dependent. These results indicate that AGL2 may play a fundamental role in the development of all floral organs, and of seeds and embryos, and that AGL2 ultimately depends upon the organ identity genes for proper expression.

AB  - The separation between monocot and dicot plants occurred about 120 - 180 million years ago and since then major morphological changes have led to the striking differences that can be observed today. To understand whether, despite these differences, the processes controlling flower development are fundamentally comparable in dicot and monocot species, it is necessary to perform comparative studies. However, until recently flower development has been studied mainly in dicot plant species. Genetic and molecular analyses of two dicot model species, Arabidopsis thaliana and Antirrhinum majus, led to the formulation of the ABC model of flower development that describes how the combined activities of three classes of genes are required to drive flower organ development. This model has recently been extended by the inclusion of two other gene classes, namely D and E, which are involved in ovule development, and petal, stamen and carpel development, respectively. Most of the A, B, C, D and E genes identified so far have been shown to encode MADS-box transcription factors. In rice a number of regulatory genes belonging to the MADS-box transcription factor family have been cloned in the last few years and the functions of some of them have been investigated in detail. Here we review the current state of knowledge on rice flower development and focus on MADS-box genes that determine floral organ identity in this species. We compare results obtained in rice with the information known for Arabidopsis and the differences between these two species are discussed.

AB  - MADS box transcription factors controlling flower development have been isolated and studied in a wide variety of organisms. These studies have shown that homologous MADS box genes from different species often have similar functions. OsMADS18 from rice (Oryza sativa) belongs to the phylogenetically defined AP1/SQUA group. The MADS box genes of this group have functions in plant development, like controlling the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth, determination of floral organ identity, and regulation of fruit maturation. In this paper we report the functional analysis of OsMADS18. This rice MADS box gene is widely expressed in rice with its transcripts accumulated to higher levels in meristems. Overexpression of OsMADS18 in rice induced early flowering, and detailed histological analysis revealed that the formation of axillary shoot meristems was accelerated. Silencing of OsMADS18 using an RNA interference approach did not result in any visible phenotypic alteration, indicating that OsMADS18 is probably redundant with other MADS box transcription factors. Surprisingly, overexpression of OsMADS18 in Arabidopsis caused a phenotype closely resembling the ap1 mutant. We show that the ap1 phenotype is not caused by down-regulation of AP1 expression. Yeast two-hybrid experiments showed that some of the natural partners of AP1 interact with OsMADS18, suggesting that the OsMADS18 overexpression phenotype in Arabidopsis is likely to be due to the subtraction of AP1 partners from active transcription complexes. Thus, when compared to AP1, OsMADS18 during evolution seems to have conserved the mechanistic properties of protein-protein interactions, although it cannot complement the AP1 function.

AB  - It is beneficial for breeding and boosting the flower value of ornamental plants such as orchids, which can take several years of growth before blooming. Over the past few years, in vitro flowering of Cymbidium nanulum Y. S. Wu et S. C. Chen has been successfully induced; nevertheless, the production of many abnormal flowers has considerably limited the efficiency of this technique. We carried out transcriptomic analysis between normal and abnormal in vitro flowers, each with four organs, to investigate key genes and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and to gain a comprehensive perspective on the formation of abnormal flowers. Thirty-six DEGs significantly enriched in plant hormone signal transduction, and photosynthesis-antenna proteins pathways were identified as key genes. Their broad upregulation and several altered transcription factors (TFs), including 11 MADS-box genes, may contribute to the deformity of in vitro flowers. By the use of weighted geneco-expression network analysis (WGCNA), three hub genes, including one unknown gene, mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) and harpin-induced gene 1/nonrace-specific disease resistance gene 1 (NDR1/HIN1-Like) were identified that might play important roles in floral organ formation. The data presented in our study may serve as a comprehensive resource for understanding the regulatory mechanisms underlying flower and floral organ formation of C. nanulum Y. S. Wu et S. C. Chen in vitro.

AB  - Plants adjust their architecture to a constantly changing environment, requiring adaptation of differential growth. Despite their importance, molecular switches, which define growth transitions, are largely unknown. Apical hook development in dark grown Arabidopsis thaliana (A. thaliana) seedlings serves as a suitable model for differential growth transition in plants. Here, we show that the phytohormone auxin counteracts the light-induced growth transition during apical hook opening. We, subsequently, identified genes which are inversely regulated by light and auxin. We used in silico analysis of the regulatory elements in this set of genes and subsequently used natural variation in gene expression to uncover correlations between underlying transcription factors and the in silico predicted target genes. This approach uncovered that MADS box transcription factor AGAMOUS-LIKE 8 (AGL8)/FRUITFULL (FUL) modulates apical hook opening. Our data shows that transient FUL expression represses the expression of growth stimulating genes during early phases of apical hook development and therewith guards the transition to growth promotion for apical hook opening. Here, we propose a role for FUL in setting tissue identity, thereby regulating differential growth during apical hook development.

AB  - The fruit ripening developmental program is specific to plants bearing fleshy fruits and dramatically changes fruit characteristics, including color, aroma, and texture. The tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) MADS box transcription factor RIPENING INHIBITOR (RIN), one of the earliest acting ripening regulators, is required for both ethylene-dependent and -independent ripening regulatory pathways. Recent studies have identified two dozen direct RIN targets, but many more RIN targets remain to be identified. Here, we report the large-scale identification of direct RIN targets by chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with DNA microarray analysis (ChIP-chip) targeting the predicted promoters of tomato genes. Our combined ChIP-chip and transcriptome analysis identified 241 direct RIN target genes that contain a RIN binding site and exhibit RIN-dependent positive or negative regulation during fruit ripening, suggesting that RIN has both activator and repressor roles. Examination of the predicted functions of RIN targets revealed that RIN participates in the regulation of lycopene accumulation, ethylene production, chlorophyll degradation, and many other physiological processes. Analysis of the effect of ethylene using 1-methylcyclopropene revealed that the positively regulated subset of RIN targets includes ethylene-sensitive and -insensitive transcription factors. Intriguingly, ethylene is involved in the upregulation of RIN expression during ripening. These results suggest that tomato fruit ripening is regulated by the interaction between RIN and ethylene signaling.

AB  - The tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) MADS box FRUITFULL homologs FUL1 and FUL2 act as key ripening regulators and interact with the master regulator MADS box protein RIPENING INHIBITOR (RIN). Here, we report the large-scale identification of direct targets of FUL1 and FUL2 by transcriptome analysis of FUL1/FUL2 suppressed fruits and chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with microarray analysis (ChIP-chip) targeting tomato gene promoters. The ChIP-chip and transcriptome analysis identified FUL1/FUL2 target genes that contain at least one genomic region bound by FUL1 or FUL2 (regions that occur mainly in their promoters) and exhibit FUL1/FUL2-dependent expression during ripening. These analyses identified 860 direct FUL1 targets and 878 direct FUL2 targets; this set of genes includes both direct targets of RIN and nontargets of RIN. Functional classification of the FUL1/FUL2 targets revealed that these FUL homologs function in many biological processes via the regulation of ripening-related gene expression, both in cooperation with and independent of RIN. Our in vitro assay showed that the FUL homologs, RIN, and tomato AGAMOUS-LIKE1 form DNA binding complexes, suggesting that tetramer complexes of these MADS box proteins are mainly responsible for the regulation of ripening.

AB  - The floral regulators GIGANTEA (GI), CONSTANS (CO), and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) play key roles in the photoperiodic flowering responses of the long-day plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The GI-CO-FT pathway is highly conserved in plants. Here, we demonstrate that the circadian clock proteins LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) and CIRCADIAN CLOCK-ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1) not only repressed the floral transition under short-day and long-day conditions but also accelerated flowering when the plants were grown under continuous light (LL). LHY and CCA1 accelerated flowering in LL by promoting FT expression through a genetic pathway that appears to be independent of the canonical photoperiodic pathway involving GI and CO proteins. A genetic screen revealed that the late-flowering phenotype of the lhy;cca1 double mutant under LL was suppressed through mutations in SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP), a MADS box transcription factor. Yeast two-hybrid analysis demonstrated an interaction between SVP and FLOWERING LOCUS C, and genetic analysis indicated that these two proteins act as partially redundant repressors of flowering time. SVP protein accumulated in lhy;cca1 plants under LL. We propose a model in which LHY and CCA1 accelerate flowering in part by reducing the abundance of SVP and thereby antagonizing its capacity to repress FT expression under LL.

AB  - Deciduous trees require sufficient chilling during winter dormancy to grow. To decipher the dormancy-regulating mechanism, we carried out RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis and metabolic profiling of European pear (Pyrus communis L.) vegetative buds during the dormancy phases. Samples were collected from two cultivars that differed greatly in their chilling requirements: 'Spadona' (SPD), a low chilling requirement cultivar; and Harrow Sweet (HS), a high chilling requirement cultivar. Comparative transcriptome analysis revealed >8500 differentially expressed transcripts; most were related to metabolic pathways. Out of 174 metabolites, 44 displayed differential levels in both cultivars, 38 were significantly changed only in SPD, and 15 only in HS. Phospholipids were mostly accumulated at the beginning of dormancy, sugars between before dormancy and mid-dormancy, and fatty acids, including alpha-linolenic acid, at dormancy break. Differentially expressed genes underlying previously identified major quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in linkage group 8 included genes related to the alpha-linolenic acid pathway, 12-oxophytodienoate reductase 2-like, and the DORMANCY-ASSOCIATED MADS-BOX (DAM) genes, PcDAM1 and PcDAM2, putative orthologs of PpDAM1 and PpDAM2, confirming their role for the first time in European pear. Additional new putative dormancy-related uncharacterized genes and genes related to metabolic pathways are suggested. These results suggest the crucial role of alpha-linolenic acid and DAM genes in pear bud dormancy phase transitions.

AB  - Methylglyoxal (MG), a toxic compound produced as a by-product of several cellular processes, such as respiration and photosynthesis, is well known for its deleterious effects, mainly through glycation of proteins during plant stress responses. However, very little is known about its impact on fruit ripening. Here, we found that MG levels are maintained at high levels in green tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) fruits and decline during fruit ripening despite a respiratory burst during this transition. We demonstrate that this decline is mainly mediated through a glutathione-dependent MG detoxification pathway and primarily catalyzed by a Glyoxalase I enzyme encoded by the SlGLYI4 gene. SlGLYI4 is a direct target of the MADS-box transcription factor RIPENING INHIBITOR (RIN), and its expression is induced during fruit ripening. Silencing of SlGLYI4 leads to drastic MG overaccumulation at ripening stages of transgenic fruits and interferes with the ripening process. MG most likely glycates and inhibits key enzymes such as methionine synthase and S-adenosyl methionine synthase in the ethylene biosynthesis pathway, thereby indirectly affecting fruit pigmentation and cell wall metabolism. MG overaccumulation in fruits of several nonripening or ripening-inhibited tomato mutants suggests that the tightly regulated MG detoxification process is crucial for normal ripening progression. Our results underpin a SlGLYI4-mediated regulatory mechanism by which MG detoxification controls fruit ripening in tomato.

AB  - The expression of the ANR1 MADS-box gene was manipulated in transgenic plants to investigate its role in the NO(3)(-)-dependent regulation of root development in Arabidopsis thaliana. Constitutive overexpression of ANR1 in roots, achieved using GAL4 enhancer trap lines, resulted in more rapid early seedling development, increased lengths and numbers of lateral roots and increased shoot fresh weight. Based on results obtained with five different enhancer trap lines, the overexpression of ANR1 in the lateral root tips appears to be more important for this phenotype than its level of expression in the developing lateral root primordia. Dexamethasone-mediated induction of ANR1 in lines expressing an ANR1-GR (glucocorticoid receptor) fusion protein stimulated lateral root growth but not primary root growth. Short-term (24 h) dexamethasone treatments led to prolonged stimulation of lateral root growth, whether the lateral roots were already mature or still unemerged at the time of treatment. In split-root experiments, localized application of dexamethasone to half of the root system of an ANR1-GR line elicited a localized increase in both the length and numbers of lateral roots, mimicking the effect of a localized NO(3)(-) treatment. In both types of transgenic line, the root phenotype was strongly dependent on the presence of NO(3)(-), indicating that there are additional components involved in ANR1 function that are NO(3)(-) regulated. The implications of these results for our understanding of ANR1's mode of action in the root response to localized NO(3)(-) are discussed.

AB  - The ANR1 MADS-box gene in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. has previously been identified as a key regulator of lateral root growth in response to signals from external nitrate (NO3(-)). We have used quantitative real-time PCR to investigate the responsiveness of ANR1 and 11 other root-expressed MADS-box genes to fluctuations in the supply of N, P and S. ANR1 expression in roots of hydroponically grown Arabidopsis plants was specifically regulated by changes in the N supply, being induced by N deprivation and rapidly repressed by N re-supply. This pattern of N responsiveness differs from the NO3(-)-inducibility of ANR1 previously observed in Arabidopsis root cultures [H.M. Zhang and B.G. Forde (1998) Science 279:407-409]. Seven of the other MADS-box genes responded to N in a manner similar to ANR1, but less strongly, while four (AGL12, AGL17, AGL18 and AGL79) were unaffected. Six of the N-regulated genes (ANR1, AGL14, AGL16, AGL19, SOC1 and AGL21) belong to just two clades within the type II MADS-box lineage, while the other two (AGL26 and AGL56) belong to the poorly characterized type I lineage. Only SOC1 was additionally found to respond to changes in the P and S supply, suggesting a possible role in a general response to nutrient stress. Studies with an ANR1 transposon-insertion mutant provided no evidence for regulatory interactions between ANR1 and the other root-expressed MADS-box genes. The implications of the current data for our understanding of the role of ANR1 and other MADS box genes in the nutritional regulation of lateral root growth are discussed.

AB  - We previously reported that the response of ANR1 expression in shoots to nitrogen (N) starvation and resupply was different from its response in roots. However, how the other root-expressed MADS box genes respond to different N fluctuations in the shoot, and how these MADS box genes respond to complete nutrient fluctuations in the root, were unknown. Results from this study have shown that some members of these root-expressed MADS box genes have different responses in the shoot and root to N treatments, whereas others have similar responses or no responses to the N treatments. Among these 12 root-expressed MADS box genes, AGL16 was the only gene to show a similar response to N fluctuation in both shoots and roots in the same way as ANR1. Results from this study have also shown that ANR1, AGL12, AGL16, AGL19, and SOC1 responded to changes of the complete nutrient condition, which might indicate that they could play key roles in general nutrient stress. These novel findings will help us to further character...

AB  - Double flowers are one of the important objectives of ornamental plant breeding. Sagittaria sagittifolia is an aquatic herb in the Alismataceae family that is widely used as an ornamental plant in gardens. However, the reference genome has not been published, and the molecular regulatory mechanism of flower formation remains unclear. In this study, single molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing technology combined with Illumina RNA-Seq was used to perform a more comprehensive analysis of S. sagittifolia for the first time. We obtained high-quality full-length transcripts, including 53,422 complete open reading frames, and identified 5980 transcription factors that belonged to 67 families, with many MADS-box genes involved in flower formation being obtained. The transcription factors regulated by plant hormone signals played an important role in the development of double flowers. We also identified an AP2 orthologous gene, SsAP2, with a deletion of the binding site for miR172, that overexpressed SsAP2 in S. sagittifolia and exhibited a delayed flowering time and an increased number of petals. This study is the first report of a full-length transcriptome of S. sagittifolia. These reference transcripts will be valuable resources for the analysis of gene structures and sequences, which provide a theoretical basis for the molecular regulatory mechanism governing the formation of double flowers.

AB  - The developmental functions of miR156-SPL regulatory network have been extensively studied in Arabidopsis, but the downstream genes regulated by each SPL have not been well characterized. In this study, Next Generation Sequencing-based transcriptome analysis was performed on roots of wild type (WT) and miR156 overexpression (miR156OE) plants. One of the SPL genes, SPL10, which represses lateral root growth in Arabidopsis, was significantly downregulated in miR156OE plants. A transcription factor, AGAMOUS-like MADS box protein 79 (AGL79), was also significantly downregulated in the miR156OE plants, but was upregulated in the SPL10 overexpression (SPL10OE) Arabidopsis plants. In addition, SPL10 was found to bind to the core consensus SPL binding sequences in AGL79 gene. Moreover, analyses of complementation lines revealed a linear relationship between SPL10 and AGL79 in regulating Arabidopsis plant development. In addition, it was observed that plant phenotypes are AGL79 dose-dependent, with higher expression causing narrow leaf shape, less number of leaves and early flowering time, whereas relatively lower AGL79 overexpression produce plants with more rosette leaves and more lateral branches. Our findings revealed direct binding of SPL10 to AGL79 promoter, which further suggests a role for miR156/SPL10 module in plant lateral root growth by directly regulating AGL79.

AB  - The changes in histone acetylation mediated by histone deacetylases (HDAC) play a crucial role in plant development and response to environmental changes. Mammalian HDACs are regulated by post-translational modifications (PTM), such as phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination and small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) modification (SUMOylation), which affect enzymatic activity and transcriptional repression. Whether PTMs of plant HDACs alter their functions are largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that the Arabidopsis SUMO E3 ligase SAP AND MIZ1 DOMAIN-CONTAINING LIGASE1 (SIZ1) interacts with HISTONE DEACETYLASE 6 (HDA6) both in vitro and in vivo. Biochemical analyses indicated that HDA6 is not modified by SUMO1. Overexpression of HDA6 in siz1-3 background results in a decreased level of histone H3 acetylation, indicating that the activity of HDA6 is increased in siz1-3 plants. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays showed that SIZ1 represses HDA6 binding to its target genes FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) and MADS AFFECTING FLOWERING 4 (MAF4), resulting in the upregulation of FLC and MAF4 by increasing the level of histone H3 acetylation. Together, these findings indicate that the Arabidopsis SUMO E3 ligase SIZ1 interacts with HDA6 and negatively regulates HDA6 function.

AB  - Elucidating molecular links between cell-fate regulatory networks and dynamic patterning modules is a key for understanding development. Auxin is important for plant patterning, particularly in roots, where it establishes positional information for cell-fate decisions. PIN genes encode plasma membrane proteins that serve as auxin efflux transporters; mutations in members of this gene family exhibit smaller roots with altered root meristems and stem-cell patterning. Direct regulators of PIN transcription have remained elusive. Here, we establish that a MADS-box gene (XAANTAL2, XAL2/AGL14) controls auxin transport via PIN transcriptional regulation during Arabidopsis root development; mutations in this gene exhibit altered stem-cell patterning, root meristem size, and root growth. XAL2 is necessary for normal shootward and rootward auxin transport, as well as for maintaining normal auxin distribution within the root. Furthermore, this MADS-domain transcription factor upregulates PIN1 and PIN4 by direct binding to regulatory regions and it is required for PIN4-dependent auxin response. In turn, XAL2 expression is regulated by auxin levels thus establishing a positive feedback loop between auxin levels and PIN regulation that is likely to be important for robust root patterning.

AB  - Background Morphogenesis depends on the concerted modulation of cell proliferation and differentiation. Such modulation is dynamically adjusted in response to various external and internal signals via complex transcriptional regulatory networks that mediate between such signals and regulation of cell-cycle and cellular responses (proliferation, growth, differentiation). In plants, which are sessile, the proliferation/differentiation balance is plastically adjusted during their life cycle and transcriptional networks are important in this process. MADS-box genes are key developmental regulators in eukaryotes, but their role in cell proliferation and differentiation modulation in plants remains poorly studied. Methods We characterize the XAL1 loss-of-function xal1-2 allele and overexpression lines using quantitative cellular and cytometry analyses to explore its role in cell cycle, proliferation, stem-cell patterning and transition to differentiation. We used quantitative PCR and cellular markers to explore if XAL1 regulates cell-cycle components and PLETHORA1 (PLT1) gene expression, as well as confocal microscopy to analyse stem-cell niche organization. Key Results We previously showed that XAANTAL1 (XAL1/AGL12) is necessary for Arabidopsis root development as a promoter of cell proliferation in the root apical meristem. Here, we demonstrate that XAL1 positively regulates the expression of PLT1 and important components of the cell cycle: CYCD3;1, CYCA2;3, CYCB1;1, CDKB1;1 and CDT1a. In addition, we show that xal1-2 mutant plants have a premature transition to differentiation with root hairs appearing closer to the root tip, while endoreplication in these plants is partially compromised. Coincidently, the final size of cortex cells in the mutant is shorter than wild-type cells. Finally, XAL1 overexpression-lines corroborate that this transcription factor is able to promote cell proliferation at the stem-cell niche. Conclusion XAL1 seems to be an important component of the networks that modulate cell proliferation/differentiation transition and stem-cell proliferation during Arabidopsis root development; it also regulates several cell-cycle components.

AB  - This study aimed at the monitoring of the apricot (Prunus armeniaca L.) ripening progression through the expression analysis of 25 genes related to fruit quality traits in nine cultivars with great differences in fruit color and ripening date. The level of pigment compounds, such as anthocyanins and carotenoids, is a key factor in food taste, and is responsible for the reddish blush color or orange skin and flesh color in apricot fruit, which are desirable quality traits in apricot breeding programs. The construction of multiple linear regression models to predict anthocyanins and carotenoids content from gene expression allows us to evaluate which genes have the strongest influence over fruit color, as these candidate genes are key during biosynthetic pathways or gene expression regulation, and are responsible for the final fruit phenotype. We propose the gene CHS as the main predictor for anthocyanins content, CCD4 and ZDS for carotenoids content, and LOX2 and MADS-box for the beginning and end of the ripening process in apricot fruit. All these genes could be applied as RNA markers to monitoring the ripening stage and estimate the anthocyanins and carotenoids content in apricot fruit during the ripening process.

AB  - A new MADS-box gene, STMADS16, has been cloned in Solanum tuberosum L. that is expressed in all vegetative tissues of the plant, mainly in the stem, but not in flower organs. STMADS16 expression is established early during vegetative development and is not regulated by light. Sequence similarity besides the spatial and temporal expression patterns allow to define a novel MADS-box subfamily comprising STMADS16 and the gene STMADS11. Expression of the STMADS16 sense cDNA under the control of the 35S cauliflower mosaic virus promoter modifies the inflorescence structure by increasing both internode length and flower proliferation of the inflorescence meristems, and confers vegetative features to the flower. Moreover, STMADS16 ectopic expression overcomes the increase in flowering time and node number produced under short-day photoperiod, while the flowering time is not affected in long-day conditions. These results are discussed in terms of a possible role for STMADS16 in promoting vegetative development.

AB  - Loquat fruit accumulates lignin in its flesh when undergoing chilling injury during postharvest storage, making it a suitable model for the study of flesh lignification. Transcriptional regulation of lignin biosynthesis is principally controlled by the NAC-MYB transcriptional cascade in model plants. Previous research has demonstrated that EjMYB8 activates lignin biosynthesis through direct interaction with the promoter of Ej4CL1. However, the classic NAC-MYB gene regulation network has not been established. Here, the MADS-box gene EjAGL65 was discovered by screening a cDNA library using the EjMYB8 promoter as bait in yeast. A phylogenetic analysis and structural comparisons revealed that EjAGL65 belongs to the Mdelta subgroup of the MADS-box family, whose members have not been reported as being involved in the regulation of lignin deposition. EjAGL65 transcription was downregulated at 0 degrees C compared to 5 degrees C, indicating a negative correlation with the change of lignin content. A dual-luciferase assay indicated that EjAGL65 is capable of inhibiting the promoter activity of EjMYB8 in vivo. These results showed that the Mdelta MADS-box gene EjAGL65 transcriptionally regulates EjMYB8 during postharvest chilling induced flesh lignification, which differs from the classical regulation model of lignin biosynthesis that has been illustrated for developmental lignin accumulation.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Lignification of fruit flesh is a common physiological disorder that occurs during post-harvest storage, resulting in the deterioration of fruit quality. Lignin deposition in loquat fruit flesh occurs due to chilling injury or senescence, at temperatures around 0 degrees C or 20 degrees C, respectively. Despite extensive research on the molecular mechanisms underlying chilling-induced lignification, the key genes responsible for the lignification process during senescence in loquat fruit remain unknown. MADS-box genes, an evolutionarily conserved transcription factor family, have been suggested to play a role in regulating senescence. However, it is still unclear whether MADS-box genes can regulate the lignin deposition that arises from fruit senescence. METHODS: Both senescence- and chilling-induced flesh lignification were simulated by applying temperature treatments on loquat fruits. The flesh lignin content during the storage was measured. Transcriptomic, quantitative reverse transcription PCR and correlation analysis were employed to identify key MADS-box genes that may be involved in flesh lignification. The Dual-luciferase assay was utilized to identify the potential interactions between MADS-box members and genes in phenylpropanoid pathway. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The lignin content of the flesh samples treated at 20 degrees C or 0 degrees C increased during storage, but at different rates. Results from transcriptome analysis, quantitative reverse transcription PCR, and correlation analysis led us to identify a senescence-specific MADS-box gene, EjAGL15, which correlated positively with the variation in lignin content of loquat fruit. Luciferase assay results confirmed that EjAGL15 activated multiple lignin biosynthesis-related genes. Our findings suggest that EjAGL15 functions as a positive regulator of senescence-induced flesh lignification in loquat fruit.

AB  - Korthalsia laciniosa (Griff.) Mart. is a climbing rattan used as a source of durable and flexible cane. In the present study, the draft genome of K. laciniosa was sequenced, de novo assembled and annotated. Genome-wide identification of MADS-Box transcription factors revealed loss of Mbeta, and Mgamma genes belonging to Type I subclass in the rattan lineage. Mining of the genome revealed presence of 13 families of lignin biosynthetic pathway genes and expression profiling of nine major genes documented relatively lower level of expression in cirrus when compared to leaflet and petiole. The chloroplast genome was re-constructed and analysis revealed the phylogenetic relatedness of this genus to Eugeissona, in contrast with its present taxonomic position. The genomic resource generated in the present study will accelerate population structure analysis, genetic resource conservation, phylogenomics and facilitate understanding the unique developmental processes like gender expression at molecular level.

AB  - Fruit development and ripening entail key biological and agronomic events, which ensure the appropriate formation and dispersal of seeds and determine productivity and yield quality traits. The MADS box gene Arlequin/tomato Agamous-like1 (hereafter referred to as TAGL1) was reported as a key regulator of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) reproductive development, mainly involved in flower development, early fruit development, and ripening. It is shown here that silencing of the TAGL1 gene (RNA interference lines) promotes significant changes affecting cuticle development, mainly a reduction of thickness and stiffness, as well as a significant decrease in the content of cuticle components (cutin, waxes, polysaccharides, and phenolic compounds). Accordingly, overexpression of TAGL1 significantly increased the amount of cuticle and most of its components while rendering a mechanically weak cuticle. Expression of the genes involved in cuticle biosynthesis agreed with the biochemical and biomechanical features of cuticles isolated from transgenic fruits; it also indicated that TAGL1 participates in the transcriptional control of cuticle development mediating the biosynthesis of cuticle components. Furthermore, cell morphology and the arrangement of epidermal cell layers, on whose activity cuticle formation depends, were altered when TAGL1 was either silenced or constitutively expressed, indicating that this transcription factor regulates cuticle development, probably through the biosynthetic activity of epidermal cells. Our results also support cuticle development as an integrated event in the fruit expansion and ripening processes that characterize fleshy-fruited species such as tomato.

AB  - Sour cherry (Prunus cerasus L.) is a valuable fruit crop in the Rosaceae family and a hybrid between progenitors closely related to extant Prunus fruticosa (ground cherry) and Prunus avium (sweet cherry). Here we report a chromosome-scale genome assembly for sour cherry cultivar Montmorency, the predominant cultivar grown in the USA. We also generated a draft assembly of P. fruticosa to use alongside a published P. avium sequence for syntelog-based subgenome assignments for 'Montmorency' and provide compelling evidence P. fruticosa is also an allotetraploid. Using hierarchal k-mer clustering and phylogenomics, we show 'Montmorency' is trigenomic, containing two distinct subgenomes inherited from a P. fruticosa-like ancestor (A and A') and two copies of the same subgenome inherited from a P. avium-like ancestor (BB). The genome composition of 'Montmorency' is AA'BB and little-to-no recombination has occurred between progenitor subgenomes (A/A' and B). In Prunus, two known classes of genes are important to breeding strategies: the self-incompatibility loci (S-alleles), which determine compatible crosses, successful fertilization, and fruit set, and the Dormancy Associated MADS-box genes (DAMs), which strongly affect dormancy transitions and flowering time. The S-alleles and DAMs in 'Montmorency' and P. fruticosa were manually annotated and support subgenome assignments. Lastly, the hybridization event 'Montmorency' is descended from was estimated to have occurred less than 1.61 million years ago, making sour cherry a relatively recent allotetraploid. The 'Montmorency' genome highlights the evolutionary complexity of the genus Prunus and will inform future breeding strategies for sour cherry, comparative genomics in the Rosaceae, and questions regarding neopolyploidy.

AB  - Gynoecium development is dependent on gene regulation and hormonal pathway interactions. The phytohormones auxin and cytokinin are involved in many developmental programs, where cytokinin is normally important for cell division and meristem activity, while auxin induces cell differentiation and organ initiation in the shoot. The MADS-box transcription factor AGAMOUS (AG) is important for the development of the reproductive structures of the flower. Here, we focus on the relationship between AG and cytokinin in Arabidopsis thaliana, and use the weak ag-12 and the strong ag-1 allele. We found that cytokinin induces carpeloid features in an AG-dependent manner and the expression of the transcription factors CRC, SHP2, and SPT that are involved in carpel development. AG is important for gynoecium development, and contributes to regulating, or else directly regulates CRC, SHP2, and SPT. All four genes respond to either reduced or induced cytokinin signaling and have the potential to be regulated by cytokinin via the type-B ARR proteins. We generated a model of a gene regulatory network, where cytokinin signaling is mainly upstream and in parallel with AG activity.

AB  - Perennial species in the boreal and temperate regions are subject to extreme annual variations in light and temperature. They precisely adapt to seasonal changes by synchronizing cycles of growth and dormancy with external cues. Annual dormancy-growth transitions and flowering involve factors that integrate environmental and endogenous signals. MADS-box transcription factors have been extensively described in the regulation of Arabidopsis flowering. However, their participation in annual dormancy-growth transitions in trees is minimal. In this study, we investigate the function of MADS12, a Populus tremula x alba SUPPRESSOR OF CONSTANS OVEREXPRESSION 1 (SOC1)-related gene. Our gene expression analysis reveals that MADS12 displays lower mRNA levels during the winter than during early spring and mid-spring. Moreover, MADS12 activation depends on the fulfillment of the chilling requirement. Hybrid poplars overexpressing MADS12 show no differences in growth cessation and bud set, while ecodormant plants display an early bud break, indicating that MADS12 overexpression promotes bud growth reactivation. Comparative expression analysis of available bud break-promoting genes reveals that MADS12 overexpression downregulates the GIBBERELLINS 2 OXIDASE 4 (GA2ox4), a gene involved in gibberellin catabolism. Moreover, the mid-winter to mid-spring RNAseq profiling indicates that MADS12 and GA2ox4 show antagonistic expression during bud dormancy release. Our results support MADS12 participation in the reactivation of shoot meristem growth during ecodormancy and link MADS12 activation and GA2ox4 downregulation within the temporal events that lead to poplar bud break.

AB  - Floral B-function MADS-box genes, such as GLOBOSA (GLO), function in corolla and stamen organ identity specification. The functions of these genes outside these floral whorls are rarely reported. DOLL1 is a GLO gene controlling corolla and androecium organ identity. In this study we found that, in Physalis floridana double-layered-lantern 1 (doll1) mutant pollinated with wild-type pollen, fruit set was extremely low, indicating that doll1 females are dysfunctional. Stigma and style structure, stigma receptivity, pollen tube guidance, and embryo sac development were also impaired in doll1. P. floridana CRABS CLAW (PFCRC), predominantly expressed in carpels, was repressed in doll1 native carpels. Loss-of-function of PFCRC altered carpel meristem determinacy, carpel closure, and ovule number, and the resultant 'pistil' consisted of multiple spirally-arranged dorsiventral carpels occasionally with 1-2 naked ovules on the margin and trichomes at each mutated carpel tip, implying an alteration of carpel organ identity. Regulatory and genetic interactions between B-class MADS-box genes and PFCRC were revealed in a context-dependent manner in floral development. Our work reveals a new role for the B-function genes in carpel and ovule development via regulating PFCRC, providing a new understanding of genetic regulatory networks between MADS-domain and CRC transcription factors in mediating carpel organ specification, functionality, and origin.

AB  - MADS-box genes encode transcription factors that play important roles in the development and evolution of plants. There are more than a dozen clades of MADS-box genes in angiosperms, of which those with functions in the specification of floral organ identity are especially well-known. From what has been elucidated in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the clade of FLC-like MADS-box genes, comprising FLC-like genes sensu strictu and MAF-like genes, are somewhat special among the MADS-box genes of plants since FLC-like genes, especially MAF-like genes, show unusual evolutionary dynamics, in that they generate clusters of tandemly duplicated genes. Here, we make use of the latest genomic data of Brassicaceae to study this remarkable feature of the FLC-like genes in a phylogenetic context. We have identified all FLC-like genes in the genomes of 29 species of Brassicaceae and reconstructed the phylogeny of these genes employing a Maximum Likelihood method. In addition, we conducted selection analyses using PAML. Our results reveal that there are three major clades of FLC-like genes in Brassicaceae that all evolve under purifying selection but with remarkably different strengths. We confirm that the tandem arrangement of MAF-like genes in the genomes of Brassicaceae resulted in a high rate of duplications and losses. Interestingly, MAF-like genes also seem to be prone to transposition. Considering the role of FLC-like genes sensu lato (s.l.) in the timing of floral transition, we hypothesize that this rapid evolution of the MAF-like genes was a main contributor to the successful adaptation of Brassicaceae to different environments.

AB  - The development of multicellular eukaryotes, according to their body plan, is often directed by members of multigene families that encode transcription factors. MADS (for MINICHROMOSOME MAINTENANCE1, AGAMOUS, DEFICIENS and SERUM RESPONSE FACTOR)-box genes form one of those families controlling nearly all major aspects of plant development. Knowing the complete complement of MADS-box genes in sequenced plant genomes will allow a better understanding of the evolutionary patterns of these genes and the association of their evolution with the evolution of plant morphologies. Here, we have applied a combination of automatic and manual annotations to identify the complete set of MADS-box genes in 17 plant genomes. Furthermore, three plant genomes were reanalyzed and published datasets were used for four genomes such that more than 2,600 genes from 24 species were classified into the two types of MADS-box genes, Type I and Type II. Our results extend previous studies, highlighting the remarkably different evolutionary patterns of Type I and Type II genes and provide a basis for further studies on the evolution and function of MADS-box genes.

AB  - MIKC(C)-group MADS-box genes are involved in the control of many developmental processes in flowering plants. All of these genes are members of one of 17 clades that had already been established in the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of extant angiosperms. These clades trace back to 11 seed plant-specific superclades that were present in the MRCA of extant seed plants. Due to their important role in plant development and evolution, the origin of the clades of MIKC(C)-group genes has been studied in great detail. In contrast, whether any of these ancestral clades has ever been lost completely in any species has not been investigated so far. Here, we determined the presence of these clades by BLAST, PSI-BLAST, and Hidden Markov Model searches and by phylogenetic methods in the whole genomes of 27 flowering plants. Our data suggest that there are only three superclades of which all members have been lost in at least one of the investigated flowering plant species, and only few additional losses of angiosperm-specific MIKC(C)-group gene clades could be identified. Remarkably, for one seed plant superclade (TM8-like genes) and one angiosperm clade (FLC-like genes), multiple losses were identified, suggesting that the function of these genes is dispensable or that gene loss might have even been adaptive. The clades of MIKC(C)-group genes that have never been wiped out in any of the investigated species comprises, in addition to the expected floral organ identity genes, also TM3-like (SOC1-like), StMADS11-like (SVP-like), AGL17-like and GGM13-like (Bsister) genes, suggesting that these genes are more important for angiosperm development and evolution than has previously been appreciated.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: MADS-box genes comprise a gene family coding for transcription factors. This gene family expanded greatly during land plant evolution such that the number of MADS-box genes ranges from one or two in green algae to around 100 in angiosperms. Given the crucial functions of MADS-box genes for nearly all aspects of plant development, the expansion of this gene family probably contributed to the increasing complexity of plants. However, the expansion of MADS-box genes during one important step of land plant evolution, namely the origin of seed plants, remains poorly understood due to the previous lack of whole-genome data for gymnosperms. METHODS: The newly available genome sequences of Picea abies, Picea glauca and Pinus taeda were used to identify the complete set of MADS-box genes in these conifers. In addition, MADS-box genes were identified in the growing number of transcriptomes available for gymnosperms. With these datasets, phylogenies were constructed to determine the ancestral set of MADS-box genes of seed plants and to infer the ancestral functions of these genes. KEY RESULTS: Type I MADS-box genes are under-represented in gymnosperms and only a minimum of two Type I MADS-box genes have been present in the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of seed plants. In contrast, a large number of Type II MADS-box genes were found in gymnosperms. The MRCA of extant seed plants probably possessed at least 11-14 Type II MADS-box genes. In gymnosperms two duplications of Type II MADS-box genes were found, such that the MRCA of extant gymnosperms had at least 14-16 Type II MADS-box genes. CONCLUSIONS: The implied ancestral set of MADS-box genes for seed plants shows simplicity for Type I MADS-box genes and remarkable complexity for Type II MADS-box genes in terms of phylogeny and putative functions. The analysis of transcriptome data reveals that gymnosperm MADS-box genes are expressed in a great variety of tissues, indicating diverse roles of MADS-box genes for the development of gymnosperms. This study is the first that provides a comprehensive overview of MADS-box genes in conifers and thus will provide a framework for future work on MADS-box genes in seed plants.

AB  - The inflorescence meristem produces floral primordia that remain undifferentiated during the first stages of flower development. Genes controlling floral meristem identity include LEAFY (LFY), APETALA1 (AP1), CAULIFLOWER (CAL), LATE MERISTEM IDENTITY 1 (LMI1), SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) and AGAMOUS-LIKE24 (AGL24). The lfy mutant shows partial reversions of flowers into inflorescence shoot-like structures and this phenotype is enhanced in the lfy ap1 double mutant. Here we show that combining the lfy mutant with agl24 and svp single mutants or with the agl24 svp double mutant enhances the lfy phenotype and that the lfy agl24 svp triple mutant phenocopies the lfy ap1 double mutant. Analysis of the molecular interactions between LFY, AGL24 and SVP showed that LFY is a repressor of AGL24 and SVP, whereas LMI1 is a positive regulator of these genes. Moreover, AGL24 and SVP positively regulate AP1 and LFY by direct binding to their regulatory regions. Since all these genes are important for establishing floral meristem identity, regulatory loops are probably important to maintain the correct relative expression levels of these genes.

AB  - In temperate cereals, such as wheat (Triticum aestivum) and barley (Hordeum vulgare), the transition to reproductive development can be accelerated by prolonged exposure to cold (vernalization). We examined the role of the grass-specific MADS box gene ODDSOC2 (OS2) in the vernalization response in cereals. The barley OS2 gene (HvOS2) is expressed in leaves and shoot apices but is repressed by vernalization. Vernalization represses OS2 independently of VERNALIZATION1 (VRN1) in a VRN1 deletion mutant of einkorn wheat (Triticum monococcum), but VRN1 is required to maintain down-regulation of OS2 in vernalized plants. Furthermore, barleys that carry active alleles of the VRN1 gene (HvVRN1) have reduced expression of HvOS2, suggesting that HvVRN1 down-regulates HvOS2 during development. Overexpression of HvOS2 delayed flowering and reduced spike, stem, and leaf length in transgenic barley plants. Plants overexpressing HvOS2 showed reduced expression of barley homologs of the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) gene FLOWERING PROMOTING FACTOR1 (FPF1) and increased expression of RNase-S-like genes. FPF1 promotes floral development and enhances cell elongation, so down-regulation of FPF1-like genes might explain the phenotypes of HvOS2 overexpression lines. We present an extended model of the genetic pathways controlling vernalization-induced flowering in cereals, which describes the regulatory relationships between VRN1, OS2, and FPF1-like genes. Overall, these findings highlight differences and similarities between the vernalization responses of temperate cereals and the model plant Arabidopsis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: MADS-domain transcription factors play important roles during plant development. The Arabidopsis MADS-box gene SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) is a key regulator of two developmental phases. It functions as a repressor of the floral transition during the vegetative phase and later it contributes to the specification of floral meristems. How these distinct activities are conferred by a single transcription factor is unclear, but interactions with other MADS domain proteins which specify binding to different genomic regions is likely one mechanism. RESULTS: To compare the genome-wide DNA binding profile of SVP during vegetative and reproductive development we performed ChIP-seq analyses. These ChIP-seq data were combined with tiling array expression analysis, induction experiments and qRT-PCR to identify biologically relevant binding sites. In addition, we compared genome-wide target genes of SVP with those published for the MADS domain transcription factors FLC and AP1, which interact with SVP during the vegetative and reproductive phases, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses resulted in the identification of pathways that are regulated by SVP including those controlling meristem development during vegetative growth and flower development whereas floral transition pathways and hormonal signaling were regulated predominantly during the vegetative phase. Thus, SVP regulates many developmental pathways, some of which are common to both of its developmental roles whereas others are specific to only one of them.

AB  - BACKGROUND: MADS-box genes encode transcription factors that are involved in developmental control and signal transduction in eukaryotes. In plants, they are associated to numerous development processes most notably those related to reproductive development: flowering induction, specification of inflorescence and flower meristems, establishment of flower organ identity, as well as regulation of fruit, seed and embryo development. Genomic analyses of MADS-box genes in different plant species are providing new relevant information on the function and evolution of this transcriptional factor family. We have performed a true genome-wide analysis of the complete set of MADS-box genes in grapevine (grapes; Vitis vinifera), analyzed their expression pattern and establish their phylogenetic relationships (including MIKC* and type I MADS-box) with genes from 16 other plant species. This study was integrated to previous works on the family in grapevine. RESULTS: A total of 90 MADS-box genes were detected in the grapevine reference genome by completing current gene annotations with a genome-wide analysis based on sequence similarity. We performed a thorough in-depth curation of all gene models and combined the results with gene expression information including RNAseq data to clarifying the expression of newly identified genes and improve their functional characterization. Curated data were uploaded to the ORCAE database for grapevine in the frame of the grapevine genome curation effort. This approach resulted in the identification of 30 additional MADS box genes. Among them, ten new MIKC(C) genes were identified, including a potential new group of short proteins similar to the SVP protein subfamily. The MIKC* subgroup contains six genes in grapevine that can be grouped in the S (4 genes) and P (2 genes) clades, showing less redundancy than that observed in Arabidopsis thaliana. Expression pattern of these genes in grapevine is compatible with a role in male gametophyte development. Most of the identified new genes belong to the type I MADS-box genes and were classified as members of the Malpha and Mgamma subclasses. Ours analyses indicate that only few members of type I genes in grapevine have homology in other species and that species-specific clades appeared both in the Malpha and Mgamma subclasses. On the other hand, as deduced from the phylogenetic analysis with other plant species, genes that can be crucial for development of central cell, endosperm and embryos seems to be conserved in plants. CONCLUSIONS: The genome analysis of MADS-box genes in grapevine, the characterization of their pattern of expression and the phylogenetic analysis with other plant species allowed the identification of new MADS-box genes not yet described in other plant species as well as basic characterization of their possible role, particularly in the case of type I and MIKC* genes.

AB  - The compelling elegance of using genome-wide scans to detect the signature of selection is difficult to resist, but is countered by the low demonstrated efficacy of pinpointing the actual genes and traits that are the targets of selection in nonmodel species. While the difficulty of going from a suggestive signature to a functional nucleotide polymorphism should not prevent researchers from using genome scans, it does lessen their long-term utility within and across study systems. In a new study published in this issue of Molecular Ecology (Mariac et al. 2011), researchers have gone a long way towards increasing the relevance of genome-wide scans for selection via two approaches: (i) they tailored the markers used in the scan to target a family of developmental genes that were good candidates for controlling a trait of interest and (ii) they used an independent mapping population to confirm the association of the gene with polymorphism in the trait of interest. All of this was completed in the nonmodel system of pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) and may provide a road map for other researchers hoping to pin down solid candidate genes for selected traits in natural or cultivated systems. Outside of these broad methodological innovations, the paper specifically focuses on a trait (flowering time) that varies across an environmental gradient (rainfall). This environmental gradient potentially serves as a model for environmental change over time, and allele frequencies at the gene can therefore be used to track how populations of pearl millet will adapt to future climate shifts at the genetic level.

AB  - The auxin-induced embryogenic reprogramming of plant somatic cells is associated with extensive modulation of the gene expression in which epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, seem to play a crucial role. However, the function of DNA methylation, including the role of auxin in epigenetic regulation of the SE-controlling genes, remains poorly understood. Hence, in the present study, we analysed the expression and methylation of the TF genes that play a critical regulatory role during SE induction (LEC1, LEC2, BBM, WUS and AGL15) in auxin-treated explants of Arabidopsis. The results showed that auxin treatment substantially affected both the expression and methylation patterns of the SE-involved TF genes in a concentration-dependent manner. The auxin treatment differentially modulated the methylation of the promoter (P) and gene body (GB) sequences of the SE-involved genes. Relevantly, the SE-effective auxin treatment (5.0 microM of 2,4-D) was associated with the stable hypermethylation of the P regions of the SE-involved genes and a significantly higher methylation of the P than the GB fragments was a characteristic feature of the embryogenic culture. The presence of auxin-responsive (AuxRE) motifs in the hypermethylated P regions suggests that auxin might substantially contribute to the DNA methylation-mediated control of the SE-involved genes.

AB  - Fruit morphogenesis is a process unique to flowering plants, and yet little is known about its developmental control. Following fertilization, fruits typically undergo a dramatic enlargement that is accompanied by differentiation of numerous distinct cell types. We have identified a mutation in Arabidopsis called fruitfull (ful-1), which abolishes elongation of the silique after fertilization. The ful-1 mutation is caused by the insertion of a DsE transposable enhancer trap element into the 5' untranslated leader of the AGL8 MADS-box gene. beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene expression in the enhancer trap line is observed specifically in all cell layers of the valve tissue, but not in the replum, the septum or the seeds, and faithfully mimics RNA in situ hybridization data reported previously. The lack of coordinated growth of the fruit tissues leads to crowded seeds, a failure of dehiscence and, frequently, the premature rupture of the carpel valves. The primary defect of ful-1 fruits is within the valves, whose cells fail to elongate and differentiate. Stomata, which are frequent along the epidermis of wild-type valves, are completely eliminated in the ful mutant valves. In addition to the effect on fruit development, ful cauline leaves are broader than those of wild type and show a reduction in the number of internal cell layers. These data suggest that AGL8/FUL regulates the transcription of genes required for cellular differentiation during fruit and leaf development.

AB  - The developmental transition to flowering is timed by endogenous and environmental signals through multiple genetic pathways. In Arabidopsis, the MADS-domain protein FLOWERING LOCUS C is a potent flowering repressor. Here, we report that the FLOWERING LOCUS C clade member MADS AFFECTING FLOWERING3 acts redundantly with another clade member to directly repress expression of the florigen FLOWERING LOCUS T and inhibit flowering. FLOWERING LOCUS C clade members act in partial redundancy in floral repression and mediate flowering responses to temperature, in addition to their participation in the flowering-time regulation by vernalization and photoperiod. We show that FLOWERING LOCUS C, MADS AFFECTING FLOWERING3 and three other clade members can directly interact with each other and form nuclear complexes, and that FLOWERING LOCUS C-dependent floral repression requires other clade members. Our results collectively suggest that the FLOWERING LOCUS C clade members act as part of several MADS-domain complexes with partial redundancy, which integrate responses to endogenous and environmental cues to control flowering.

AB  - Litchi possesses unique flower morphology and adaptive reproduction strategies. Although previous attention has been intensively devoted to the mechanisms underlying its floral induction, the molecular basis of flower sex determination remains largely unknown. MADS-box genes are promising candidates for this due to their significant roles in various aspects of inflorescence and flower organogenesis. Here, we present a detailed overview of phylogeny and expression profiles of 101 MADS-box genes that were identified in litchi. These LcMADSs are unevenly located across the 15 chromosomes and can be divided into type I and type II genes. Fifty type I MADS-box genes are subdivided into Malpha, Mbeta and Mgamma subgroups, while fifty-one type II LcMADSs consist of 37 MIKC(C) -type and 14 MIKC *-type genes. Promoters of both types of LcMADS genes contain mainly ABA and MeJA response elements. Tissue-specific and development-related expression analysis reveal that LcMADS51 could be positively involved in litchi carpel formation, while six MADS-box genes, including LcMADS42/46/47/75/93/100, play a possible role in stamen development. GA is positively involved in the sex determination of litchi flowers by regulating the expression of LcMADS51 (LcSTK). However, JA down-regulates the expression of floral organ identity genes, suggesting a negative role in litchi flower development.

AB  - Ripening is the last, irreversible developmental stage during which fruit become palatable, thus promoting seed dispersal by frugivory. In Alisa Craig fruit, mRNAs with increasing m5C levels, such as STPK and WRKY 40, were identified as being involved in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. Furthermore, two mRNAs involved in cell wall metabolism, PG and EXP-B1, also presented increased m5C levels. In the Nr mutant, several m5C-modified mRNAs involved in fruit ripening, including those encoding WRKY and MADS-box proteins, were found. Targets of long non-coding RNAs and circular RNAs with different m5C sites were also found; these targets included 2-alkenal reductase, soluble starch synthase 1, WRKY, MADS-box, and F-box/ketch-repeat protein SKIP11. A combined analysis of changes in 5mC methylation and mRNA revealed many differentially expressed genes with differentially methylated regions encoding transcription factors and key enzymes related to ethylene biosynthesis and signal transduction; these included ERF084, EIN3, AP2/ERF, ACO5, ACS7, EIN3/4, EBF1, MADS-box, AP2/ERF, and ETR1. Taken together, our findings contribute to the global understanding of the mechanisms underlying fruit ripening, thereby providing new information for both fruit and post-harvest behavior.

AB  - MADS-domain proteins are important transcription factors that are involved in many biological processes of plants. In the present study, SlMBP11, a member of the AGL15 subfamily, was cloned in tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicon M.). SlMBP11 is ubiquitously expressed in all of the tissues we examined, whereas the SlMBP11 transcription levels were significantly higher in reproductive tissues than in vegetative tissues. Plants exhibiting increased SlMBP11 levels displayed reduced plant height, leaf size, and internode length as well as a loss of dominance in young seedlings, highly branched growth from each leaf axil, and increased number of nodes and leaves. Moreover, overexpression lines also exhibited reproductive phenotypes, such as those having a shorter style and split ovary, leading to polycarpous fruits, while the wild type showed normal floral organization. In addition, delayed perianth senescence was observed in transgenic tomatoes. These phenotypes were further confirmed by analyzing the morphological, anatomical and molecular features of lines exhibiting overexpression. These results suggest that SlMBP11 plays an important role in regulating plant architecture and reproductive development in tomato plants. These findings add a new class of transcription factors to the group of genes controlling axillary bud growth and illuminate a previously uncharacterized function of MADS-box genes in tomato plants.

AB  - Coordinated plant adaptation involves the interplay of multiple traits driven by habitat-specific selection pressures. Pleiotropic effects, wherein genetic variants of a single gene control multiple traits, can expedite such adaptations. Until present, only a limited number of genes have been reported to exhibit pleiotropy. Here, we create a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from two Arabidopsis thaliana (A. thaliana) ecotypes originating from divergent habitats. Using this RIL population, we identify an allelic variation in a MADS-box transcription factor, SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP), which exerts a pleiotropic effect on leaf size and drought-versus-humidity tolerance. Further investigation reveals that a natural null variant of the SVP protein disrupts its normal regulatory interactions with target genes, including GRF3, CYP707A1/3, and AtBG1, leading to increased leaf size, enhanced tolerance to humid conditions, and changes in flowering time of humid conditions in A. thaliana. Remarkably, polymorphic variations in this gene have been traced back to early A. thaliana populations, providing a genetic foundation and plasticity for subsequent colonization of diverse habitats by influencing multiple traits. These findings advance our understanding of how plants rapidly adapt to changing environments by virtue of the pleiotropic effects of individual genes on multiple trait alterations.

AB  - Multiple small molecule hormones contribute to growth promotion or restriction in plants. Brassinosteroids (BRs), acting specifically in the epidermis, can both drive and restrict shoot growth. However, our knowledge of how BRs affect meristem size is scant. Here, we study the root meristem and show that BRs are required to maintain normal cell cycle activity and cell expansion. These two processes ensure the coherent gradient of cell progression, from the apical to the basal meristem. In addition, BR activity in the meristem is not accompanied by changes in the expression level of the auxin efflux carriers PIN1, PIN3 and PIN7, which are known to control the extent of mitotic activity and differentiation. We further demonstrate that BR signaling in the root epidermis and not in the inner endodermis, quiescent center (QC) cells or stele cell files is sufficient to control root meristem size. Interestingly, expression of the QC and the stele-enriched MADS-BOX gene AGL42 can be modulated by BRI1 activity solely in the epidermis. The signal from the epidermis is probably transmitted by a different component than BES1 and BZR1 transcription factors, as their direct targets, such as DWF4 and BRox2, are regulated in the same cells that express BRI1. Taken together, our study provides novel insights into the role of BRs in controlling meristem size.

AB  - Saffron is the world highest-priced spice because its production requires intensive hand labour. Reduce saffron production costs require containerised plant production under controlled conditions and expand the flowering period. Controlling the flowering process and identify the factors involved in saffron flowering is crucial to introduce technical improvements. The research carried out so far in saffron has allowed an extensive knowledge of the influence of temperature on the flower induction, but the molecular mechanisms controlling flowering induction processes are largely unknown. The present study is the first conducted to isolate and characterize a regulator gene of saffron floral induction the Short Vegetative Phase (SVP) gene, which represses the floral initiation genes in the temperature response pathway, which involved in saffron flower induction. The results obtained from both phylogenetic analysis and T-coffee alignment confirms that the isolated sequence belongs to the SVP gene clades of MADS-box gene family. Gene expression analysis in different developmental stages revealed the highest expression of SVP transcript (CsSVP) during the dormancy and the vegetative stages, but decrease when flower development initiated and it was the least in late September when flower primordia are developed. Furthermore, its expression increased in the apical bud when corms are storage at 9-10 masculineC, thus inhibiting flower induction. Additionally, comparison of the CsSVP transcript in apical buds from big and small corms, differing in their flowering capacity, indicates that the CsSVP transcript is present only in vegetative buds. Taken together, these results suggested inhibitory role of the SVP gene.

AB  - Redox homeostasis has been linked to proper anther and pollen development. Accordingly, plant cells have developed several Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)-scavenging mechanisms to maintain the redox balance. Hemopexins constitute one of these mechanisms preventing heme-associated oxidative stress in animals, fungi, and plants. Pisum sativum ENDOTHECIUM 1 (PsEND1) is a pea anther-specific gene that encodes a protein containing four hemopexin domains. We report the functional characterization of PsEND1 and the identification in its promoter region of cis-regulatory elements that are essential for the specific expression in anthers. PsEND1 promoter deletion analysis revealed that a putative CArG-like regulatory motif is necessary to confer promoter activity in developing anthers. Our data suggest that PsEND1 might be a hemopexin regulated by a MADS-box protein. PsEND1 gene silencing in pea, and its overexpression in heterologous systems, result in similar defects in the anthers consisting of precocious tapetum degradation and the impairment of pollen development. Such alterations were associated to the production of superoxide anion and altered activity of ROS-scavenging enzymes. Our findings demonstrate that PsEND1 is essential for pollen development by modulating ROS levels during the differentiation of the anther tissues surrounding the microsporocytes.

AB  - Pod corn (Zea mays var tunicata) was once regarded as ancestral to cultivated maize, and was prized by pre-Columbian cultures for its magical properties. Tunicate1 (Tu1) is a dominant pod corn mutation in which kernels are completely enclosed in leaflike glumes. Here we show that Tu1 encodes a MADS box transcription factor expressed in leaves whose 5' regulatory region is fused by a 1.8-Mb chromosomal inversion to the 3' region of a gene expressed in the inflorescence. Both genes are further duplicated, accounting for classical derivative alleles isolated by recombination, and Tu1 transgenes interact with these derivative alleles in a dose-dependent manner. In young ear primordia, TU1 proteins are nuclearly localized in specific cells at the base of spikelet pair meristems. Tu1 branch determination defects resemble those in ramosa mutants, which encode regulatory proteins expressed in these same cells, accounting for synergism in double mutants discovered almost 100 years ago. The Tu1 rearrangement is not found in ancestral teosinte and arose after domestication of maize.

AB  - The photoperiod pathway is a genetically conserved pathway that affects flowering in distantly related angiosperms. Here we report a novel flowering promoter AGAMOUS-LIKE 17 (AGL17) acting in the photoperiod pathway of Arabidopsis. AGL17 transcripts were detectable in various plant organs with the highest expression in the root. Under long-day conditions, expression of AGL17 gradually increased in the aerial part of seedlings during the floral transition. Overexpression of AGL17 caused early flowering, while loss of function of AGL17 exhibited late flowering, particularly under long days. Analysis of AGL17 expression in various flowering-time mutants showed that its transcripts were significantly reduced in the photoperiod pathway mutant co-1. Correspondingly, AGL17 expression was upregulated in transgenic plants overexpressing CONSTANS (CO) and also when CO activity was induced by light. Genetic analysis further showed that overexpression of AGL17 could partially suppress the late flowering of co-1. These results suggest that AGL17 acts to promote flowering and is positively controlled by the photoperiod pathway regulator CO. In contrast, another target of CO, FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), did not affect AGL17 expression, and vice versa. The expression of two floral meristem identity genes LEAFY (LFY) and APETALA1 (AP1) decreased in agl17-1, while LFY and AP1 could be rapidly induced by AGL17 using a functional estradiol-inducible system. These findings indicate that AGL17 ultimately promotes flowering via regulation of LFY and AP1.

AB  - Bolting in lettuce is promoted by high temperature and bolting resistance is of great economic importance for lettuce production. But how bolting is regulated at the molecular level remains elusive. Here, a bolting resistant line S24 and a bolting sensitive line S39 were selected for morphological, physiological, transcriptomic and proteomic comparisons. A total of 12204 genes were differentially expressed in S39 vs. S24. Line S39 was featured with larger leaves, higher levels of chlorophyll, soluble sugar, anthocyanin and auxin, consistent with its up-regulation of genes implicated in photosynthesis, oxidation-reduction and auxin actions. Proteomic analysis identified 30 differentially accumulated proteins in lines S39 and S24 upon heat treatment, and 19 out of the 30 genes showed differential expression in the RNA-Seq data. Exogenous gibberellins (GA) treatment promoted bolting in both S39 and S24, while 12 flowering promoting MADS-box genes were specifically induced in line S39, suggesting that although GA regulates bolting in lettuce, it may be the MADS-box genes, not GA, that plays a major role in differing the bolting resistance between these two lettuce lines.

AB  - Leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula L.) is a noxious perennial weed that produces underground adventitious buds, which are crucial for generating new vegetative shoots following periods of freezing temperatures or exposure to various control measures. It is also capable of flowering and producing seeds, but requires vernalization in some cases. DORMANCY ASSOCIATED MADS-BOX (DAM) genes have been proposed to play a direct role in the transition to winter-induced dormancy and maintenance through regulation of the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) gene, which also is likely involved in the vernalization process. To explore the regulation of FT and DAM during dormancy transitions in leafy spurge, the transcript accumulation of two previously cloned DAM splice variants and two different previously cloned FT genes was characterized. Under long-photoperiods (16 h light), both DAM and FT transcripts accumulate in a diurnal manner. Tissue specific expression patterns indicated the tissues with high DAM expression had low FT expression and vice versa. DAM expression is detected in leaves, stems, shoot tips, and crown buds. FT transcripts were detected mainly in leaves and flowers. Under dormancy inducing conditions, DAM and FT genes had an inverse expression pattern. Additionally, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed using DAM-like protein specific antibodies to demonstrate that DAM or related proteins likely bind to cryptic and/or conserved CArG boxes in the promoter regions of FT genes isolated from endodormant crown buds. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that DAM proteins play a crucial role in leafy spurge dormancy transition and maintenance, potentially by negatively regulating the expression of FT.

AB  - The MADS box motif is common to genes that regulate the pattern of flower development. To determine whether MADS box genes also play a role in differentiation of the sexes in dioecious plants, we isolated cDNAs (SLM1 to SLM5, for Silene latifolia MADS) with MADS box homology from transcripts of male flower buds of the model dioecious species white campion and compared their expression in developing female and male flowers. SLM1 had extensive sequence similarity to the snapdragon MADS box gene PLENA, SLM2 to GLOBOSA, SLM3 to DEFICIENS, and both SLM4 and SLM5 were similar to SQUAMOSA. Each of the white campion MADS box genes was expressed in the same floral whorls as their respective most homologous snapdragon genes. The sex of the plant affected the pattern of SLM2 and SLM3 expression in the petal and stamen whorls, resulting in a smaller fourth whorl in male flowers than in female flowers. This was correlated with repressed gynoecium development in male flowers. The expression of SLM4 and SLM5 in both sexes differed from that of SQUAMOSA in one important aspect. Unlike SQUAMOSA, they were expressed in inflorescence meristems. This may reflect differences in growth pattern between white campion and snapdragon.

AB  - The potato MADS-box gene POTM1 is a member of the SQUA-like family of plant MADS-box genes. The amino acid sequence of POTM1 most closely matches the sequence of PFG (Petunia Flowering Gene), a petunia MADS-box gene involved in the transition from vegetative to reproductive development. To examine the likely role of POTM1 in potato reproductive tissue, in situ hybridizations were performed on sections of the potato shoot apex at various stages during the transition to flowering. Scanning electron micrographs provide a reference for each stage to illustrate the progression from vegetative meristem to inflorescence meristem and floral organs. POTM1 mRNA accumulates in vegetative, inflorescence and floral meristems. Transcripts are present in petal primordia during the later stages of petal development and they accumulate later during floral development inside the stamens and carpels, but not in carpel walls. This widespread pattern of mRNA accumulation is unique among the SQUA-like genes and indicates that POTM1 is active during a variety of stages of development, and may function in regulating cell determination in transitional phases of both vegetative and floral meristems.

AB  - The highly diverse Solanaceae family contains several widely studied models and crop species. Fully exploring, appreciating, and exploiting this diversity requires additional model systems. Particularly promising are orphan fruit crops in the genus Physalis, which occupy a key evolutionary position in the Solanaceae and capture understudied variation in traits such as inflorescence complexity, fruit ripening and metabolites, disease and insect resistance, self-compatibility, and most notable, the striking inflated calyx syndrome (ICS), an evolutionary novelty found across angiosperms where sepals grow exceptionally large to encapsulate fruits in a protective husk. We recently developed transformation and genome editing in Physalis grisea (groundcherry). However, to systematically explore and unlock the potential of this and related Physalis as genetic systems, high-quality genome assemblies are needed. Here, we present chromosome-scale references for P. grisea and its close relative Physalis pruinosa and use these resources to study natural and engineered variations in floral traits. We first rapidly identified a natural structural variant in a bHLH gene that causes petal color variation. Further, and against expectations, we found that CRISPR-Cas9-targeted mutagenesis of 11 MADS-box genes, including purported essential regulators of ICS, had no effect on inflation. In a forward genetics screen, we identified huskless, which lacks ICS due to mutation of an AP2-like gene that causes sepals and petals to merge into a single whorl of mixed identity. These resources and findings elevate Physalis to a new Solanaceae model system and establish a paradigm in the search for factors driving ICS.

AB  - Previous studies have reported that SEEDSTICK/AGAMOUS-LIKE 11 (AtSTK/AtAGL11), a MADS-box transcription factor, plays important roles in many biological processes in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, the function of BnaAGL11, an AtAGL11 homologous gene from Brassica napus, in leaf development remains unknown. Here, we found that the ectopic expression of any copy of Bna.C09.AGL11, Bna.A03.AGL11, and Bna.A09.AGL11 in A. thaliana led to smaller and curly leaves and promoted leaf senescence. Consistently, the overexpression of Bna.C09.AGL11 in B. napus also caused smaller and curly leaves and accelerated leaf senescence. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Bna.C09.AGL11 controlled leaf morphogenesis by indirectly downregulating the genes of Bna.A01.DWF4 and Bna.C07.PGX3 and promoted leaf senescence by indirectly upregulating the genes of Bna.A04.ABI5, Bna.A05.ABI5, Bna.C04.ABI5-1, and Bna.C01.SEN4 and directly activating the transcription of Bna.C04.ABI5-2 and Bna.C03.SEN4 genes. Our results provide new insights into the underlying regulatory mechanism of BnaAGL11 during leaf development in B. napus.

AB  - Transcriptional regulation is essential for balancing multiple metabolic pathways that influence oil accumulation in seeds. Thus far, the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that govern seed oil accumulation remain largely unknown. Here, we identified the transcriptional regulatory network composed of MADS-box transcription factors SEEDSTICK (STK) and SEPALLATA3 (SEP3), which bridges several key genes to regulate oil accumulation in seeds. We found that STK, highly expressed in the developing embryo, positively regulates seed oil accumulation in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Furthermore, we discovered that SEP3 physically interacts with STK in vivo and in vitro. Seed oil content is increased by the SEP3 mutation, while it is decreased by SEP3 overexpression. The chromatin immunoprecipitation, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and transient dual-luciferase reporter assays showed that STK positively regulates seed oil accumulation by directly repressing the expression of MYB5, SEP3, and SEED FATTY ACID REDUCER 4 (SFAR4). Moreover, genetic and molecular analyses demonstrated that STK and SEP3 antagonistically regulate seed oil production and that SEP3 weakens the binding ability of STK to MYB5, SEP3, and SFAR4. Additionally, we demonstrated that TRANSPARENT TESTA 8 (TT8) and ACYL-ACYL CARRIER PROTEIN DESATURASE 3 (AAD3) are direct targets of MYB5 during seed oil accumulation in Arabidopsis. Together, our findings provide the transcriptional regulatory network antagonistically orchestrated by STK and SEP3, which fine tunes oil accumulation in seeds.

AB  - The endosperm is a terminal seed tissue that is destined to support embryo development. In most angiosperms, the endosperm develops initially as a syncytium to facilitate rapid seed growth. The transition from the syncytial to the cellularized state occurs at a defined time point during seed development. Manipulating the timing of endosperm cellularization through interploidy crosses negatively impacts on embryo growth, suggesting that endosperm cellularization is a critical step during seed development. In this study, we show that failure of endosperm cellularization in fertilization independent seed 2 (fis2) and endosperm defective 1 (ede1) Arabidopsis mutants correlates with impaired embryo development. Restoration of endosperm cellularization in fis2 seeds by reducing expression of the MADS-box gene AGAMOUS-LIKE 62 (AGL62) promotes embryo development, strongly supporting an essential role of endosperm cellularization for viable seed formation. Endosperm cellularization failure in fis2 seeds correlates with increased hexose levels, suggesting that arrest of embryo development is a consequence of failed nutrient translocation to the developing embryo. Finally, we demonstrate that AGL62 is a direct target gene of FIS Polycomb group repressive complex 2 (PRC2), establishing the molecular basis for FIS PRC2-mediated endosperm cellularization.

AB  - Deceptive Ceropegia pitfall flowers are an outstanding example of synorganized morphological complexity. Floral organs functionally synergise to trap fly-pollinators inside the fused corolla. Successful pollination requires precise positioning of flies headfirst into cavities at the gynostegium. These cavities are formed by the corona, a specialized organ of corolline and/or staminal origin. The interplay of floral organs to achieve pollination is well studied but their evolutionary origin is still unclear. We aimed to obtain more insight in the homology of the corona and therefore investigated floral anatomy, ontogeny, vascularization, and differential MADS-box gene expression in Ceropegia sandersonii using X-ray microtomography, Light and Scanning Electronic Microscopy, and RT-PCR. During 10 defined developmental phases, the corona appears in phase 7 at the base of the stamens and was not found to be vascularized. A floral reference transcriptome was generated and 14 MADS-box gene homologs, representing all major MADS-box gene classes, were identified. B- and C-class gene expression was found in mature coronas. Our results indicate staminal origin of the corona, and we propose a first ABCDE-model for floral organ identity in Ceropegia to lay the foundation for a better understanding of the molecular background of pitfall flower evolution in Apocynaceae.

AB  - MADS-box transcription factors specify plant meristem identity. In doing so, they determine when floral organs are produced at the shoot apex and control the timing of flowering. The transcriptional activity of key MADS-box genes is controlled by temperature in many plants, and this synchronises flowering with changing seasons. Here we review how seasonal temperature variation influences the developmental programme of plants via transcriptional regulation of MADS-box genes. In particular we examine the role of MADS-box genes in regulating the acceleration of flowering by vernalization (prolonged periods of cold), using FLOWERING LOCUS C of Arabidopsis and VERNALIZATION1 of cereals as examples. A potential role for SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE-like genes in controlling winter bud dormancy is also examined, as are potential roles for MADS-box genes in regulating developmental responses to elevated growth temperatures. We conclude that understanding how temperature regulates the transcription of MADS-box genes provides insight into how seasonal fluctuations in temperature influence plant development. Plant breeders may be able to use natural variation in temperature-responsive MADS-box genes to breed future crop varieties.

AB  - Characterization of seven MADS-box genes, termed PPM1-PPM4 and PpMADS1-PpMADS3, from the moss model species Physcomitrella patens is reported. Phylogeny reconstructions and comparison of exon-intron structures revealed that the genes described here represent two different classes of homologous, yet distinct, MIKC-type MADS-box genes, termed MIKC(c)-type genes-"(c)" stands for "classic"-(PPM1, PPM2, PpMADS1) and MIKC(*)-type genes (PPM3, PPM4, PpMADS2, PpMADS3). The two gene classes deviate from each other in a characteristic way, especially in a sequence stretch termed intervening region. MIKC(c)-type genes are abundantly present in all land plants which have been investigated in this respect, and give rise to well-known gene types such as floral meristem and organ identity genes. In contrast, LAMB1 from the clubmoss Lycopodium annotinum was identified as the only other MIKC(*)-type gene published so far. Our findings strongly suggest that the most recent common ancestor of mosses and vascular plants contained at least one MIKC(c)-type and one MIKC(*)-type gene. Our studies thus reveal an ancient duplication of an MIKC-type gene that occurred before the separation of the lineages that led to extant mosses and vascular plants more than about 450 MYA. The identification of bona fide K-domains in both MIKC(*)-type and MIKC(c)-type proteins suggests that the K-domain is more ancient than is suggested by a recent alternative hypothesis. MIKC(*)-type genes may have escaped identification in ferns and seed plants so far. It seems more likely, however, that they represent a class of genes which has been lost in the lineage which led to extant ferns and seed plants. The high number of P. patens MADS-box genes and the presence of a K-box in the coding region and of some potential binding sites for MADS-domain proteins and other transcription factors in the putative promoter regions of these genes suggest that MADS-box genes in mosses are involved in complex gene regulatory networks similar to those in flowering plants.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fruit abscission in an isolated region called abscission zone (AZ) is regulated by several genes including JOINTLESS, MACROCALYX and SEPALLATA, MADS-box genes, in tomato. OBJECTIVE: The surviving central pedicels and the abscised lateral pedicels were examined in fruit clusters in order to investigate apple MADS-box genes from fruit pedicels of self-abscising apple 'Saika' during early fruit abscission. METHODS: After performing RNA-Seq, transcription profiling was conducted on the MADS-box genes from apple central and lateral pedicels. The JOINTLESS homolog of apple (MdJOINTLESS) was amplified using degenerate primers annealing to a highly conserved domain based on the orthologous genes of various crops, including JOINTLESS gene of tomato. The expression pattern of MdJOINTLESS was investigated in central and lateral pedicles by real-time PCR. RESULTS: Some homologs were found which similar to JOINTLESS, MACROCALYX and SEPALLATA of tomato MADS-box genes from transcriptome analysis and RACE. Using phylogenetic analyses with the MADS-box gene family, MdJOINTLESS was classified into the SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) clade that included Arabidopsis and other crops. The expression level of MdJOINTLESS in central pedicel was more than twice as high as that of lateral pedicel. CONCLUSION: In the current study, we could find apple homologs of JOINTLESS, MACROCALYX, SEPALLATA, which were known to regulate pedicel AZ development in tomato. Furthermore, MdJOINTLESS might contribute to auxin gradation, influencing hierarchical ranking of auxin transport between fruit pedicels of self-abscising apple.

AB  - MIKCc-type MADS-box genes encode key transcriptional regulators of a variety of developmental processes in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, there has been relatively little effort to systematically carry out comparative genomic or functional analyses of these genes across flowering plants. Here we describe a strategy to identify members of the MIKCc-type MADS-box gene family from any angiosperm species of interest. Using this approach, we have identified 24 MIKCc-type MADS-box genes in tomato, including 17 that have not previously been characterized. Using these sequences, we have performed phylogenetic analyses that indicate that there have been a number of gene duplication and loss events in tomato relative to Arabidopsis. We also describe the expression domains of these genes and compare these results with their cognates in Arabidopsis. These analyses demonstrate the utility of this approach for characterizing a large number of MIKCc-type MADS-box genes from any flowering plant species of interest and provide a framework for evolutionary comparisons of this important gene family across angiosperms.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nuclear endosperm development is a common mechanism among Angiosperms, including Arabidopsis. During nuclear development, the endosperm nuclei divide rapidly after fertilization without cytokinesis to enter the syncytial phase, which is then followed by the cellularized phase. The endosperm can be divided into three spatial domains with distinct functions: the micropylar, peripheral, and chalazal domains. Previously, we identified two putative small invertase inhibitors, InvINH1 and InvINH2, that are specifically expressed in the micropylar region of the syncytial endosperm. In addition, ectopically expressing InvINH1 in the cellularized endosperm led to a reduction in embryo growth rate. However, it is not clear what are the upstream regulators responsible for the specific expression of InvINHs in the syncytial endosperm. RESULTS: Using protoplast transient expression system, we discovered that a group of type I MADS box transcription factors can form dimers to activate InvINH1 promoter. Promoter deletion assays carried out in the protoplast system revealed the presence of an enhancer region in InvINH1 promoter, which contains several consensus cis-elements for the MADS box proteins. Using promoter deletion assay in planta, we further demonstrated that this enhancer region is required for InvINH1 expression in the syncytial endosperm. One of the MADS box genes, AGL62, is a key transcription factor required for syncytial endosperm development. Using promoter-GFP reporter assay, we demonstrated that InvINH1 and InvINH2 are not expressed in agl62 mutant seeds. Collectively, our data supports the role of AGL62 and other type I MADS box genes as the upstream activators of InvINHs expression in the syncytial endosperm. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed several type I MADS box genes that are responsible for activating InvINH1 in the syncytial endosperm, which in turn regulates embryo growth rate during early stage of seed development.

AB  - Genetic studies, using floral homeotic mutants, have led to the ABC model of flower development. This model proposes that the combinatorial action of three sets of genes, the A, B and C function genes, specify the four floral organs (sepals, petals, stamens and carpels) in the concentric floral whorls. However, attempts to convert vegetative organs into floral organs by altering the expression of ABC genes have been unsuccessful. Here we show that the class B proteins of Arabidopsis, PISTILLATA (PI) and APETALA3 (AP3), interact with APETALA1 (AP1, a class A protein) and SEPALLATA3 (SEP3, previously AGL9), and with AGAMOUS (AG, a class C protein) through SEP3. We also show that vegetative leaves of triply transgenic plants, 35S::PI;35S::AP3;35S::AP1 or 35S::PI;35S::AP3;35S::SEP3, are transformed into petaloid organs and that those of 35S::PI;35S::AP3;35S::SEP3;35S::AG are transformed into staminoid organs. Our findings indicate that the formation of ternary and quaternary complexes of ABC proteins may be the molecular basis of the ABC model, and that the flower-specific expression of SEP3 restricts the action of the ABC genes to the flower.

AB  - MADS-box transcription factors are essential mediators of the vegetative and reproductive development of seed plants. Although MADS-box genes have been extensively characterized in angiosperms, their functions are not well-understood in gymnosperms, especially the Gnetales, due to an ambiguous phylogeny of seed plants. Here, we performed a genome-wide search for MADS-box genes in Gnetum luofuense and found 11 Type I and 38 Type II MADS-box members (i.e. three MIKC* and 35 MIKCc genes). The relative abundance of the Type I Mα and Type II MIKCC subgroups (including the DEF/GLO and TM8-like genes) were mainly contributed by tandem duplications. Comparisons of the gene expression levels among members of the MIKCc subgroup reveal that the DEF/GLO-like genes and several TM8-like genes were exclusively expressed in reproductive organs, whereas TM3-like, StMADS11-like and other TM8-like genes exhibited a broad expression pattern in both vegetative and reproductive organs in G. luofuense. In addition, 14 Type II MIKCc genes were found in the stem transcriptome of Ephedra equisetina and we made an attempt to assess the homology to the MIKCc genes within Gnetales. The results of this study provide valuable information for understanding the phylogenies and functions of MADS-box genes in seed plants.

AB  - PISTILLATA (PI), as a member of MADS-box transcription factor, plays an important role in petal and stamen specification in Arabidopsis. However, little is known about PI-like genes in citrus. To understand the molecular mechanism of PI during the developmental process of citrus flower, a PI-like gene CcMADS20 was isolated from Citrus Clemantina. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis revealed that CcMADS20 had relatively high similarity with PI-like homolog and was classified in the core dicotyledonous group. The temporal and spatial expression analyses showed that CcMADS20 was specifically expressed in petal and stamen of citrus flower, which was consistent with PI expression pattern in Arabidopsis. Protein interaction revealed that CcMADS20 could form heterodimer with AP3-like proteins. Furthermore, ectopic overexpression of CcMADS20 in Arabidopsis resulted in transformation of sepals into petal-like structure, as observed in other plants overexpressing a functional PI-like homolog. Additionally, promoter fragments of CcMADS20 were also cloned in the representative 21 citrus varieties. Interestingly, four types of promoters were discovered in these citrus varieties, resulting from two stable insert/deletion fragments (Locus1 and Locus2). The homo/hetero-zygosity of promoter alleles in each variety was strongly related to the evolutionary origin of citrus. Four promoters activity analysis indicated that Locus1 presence inhibited CcMADS20 transcriptional activity and Locus2 presence promoted its transcriptional activity. These findings suggested that CcMADS20 determines petal and stamen development during the evolutionary process of citrus and four promoters discovered, as effective genetic markers, are valuable for citrus breeding practices.

AB  - We previously found that B and AGL6 proteins form L (OAP3-2/OAGL6-2/OPI) and SP (OAP3-1/OAGL6-1/OPI) complexes to determine lip/sepal/petal identities in orchids. Here, we show that the functional L' (OAP3-1/OAGL6-2/OPI) and SP' (OAP3-2/OAGL6-1/OPI) complexes likely exist and AP3/PI/AGL6 genes have acquired additional functions during evolution. We demonstrate that the presumed L' complex changes the structure of the lower lateral sepals and helps the lips fit properly in the center of the flower. In addition, we find that OAP3-1/OAGL6-1/OPI in SP along with presumed SP' complexes regulate anthocyanin accumulation and pigmentation, whereas presumed L' along with OAP3-2/OAGL6-2/OPI in L complexes promotes red spot formation in the perianth. Furthermore, the B functional proteins OAP3-1/OPI and OAGL6-1 in the SP complex could function separately to suppress sepal/petal senescence and promote pedicel abscission, respectively. These findings expand the current knowledge behind the multifunctional evolution of the B and AGL6 genes in plants.

AB  - Arabidopsis AGL13 is a member of the AGL6 clade of the MADS box gene family. GUS activity was specifically detected from the initiation to maturation of both pollen and ovules in AGL13:GUS Arabidopsis. The sterility of the flower with defective pollen and ovules was found in AGL13 RNAi knockdown and AGL13 + SRDX dominant-negative mutants. These results indicate that AGL13 acts as an activator in regulation of early initiation and further development of pollen and ovules. The production of similar floral organ defects in the severe AGL13 + SRDX and SEP2 + SRDX plants and the similar enhancement of AG nuclear localization efficiency by AGL13 and SEP3 proteins suggest a similar function for AGL13 and E functional SEP proteins. Additional fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis indicated that, similar to SEP proteins, AGL13 is able to interact with AG to form quartet-like complexes (AGL13-AG)2 and interact with AG-AP3-PI to form a higher-order heterotetrameric complex (AGL13-AG-AP3-PI). Through these complexes, AGL13 and AG could regulate the expression of similar downstream genes involved in pollen morphogenesis, anther cell layer formation and the ovule development. AGL13 also regulates AG/AP3/PI expression by positive regulatory feedback loops and suppresses its own expression through negative regulatory feedback loops by activating AGL6, which acts as a repressor of AGL13. Our data suggest that AGL13 is likely a putative ancestor for the E functional genes which specifies male and female gametophyte morphogenesis in plants during evolution.

AB  - Oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) is a well-known vegetable oil-yielding crop. Seedlessness is one of the most prominent traits in oil palm due to its low processing costs and high oil content. Nevertheless, an extensive study on molecular mechanisms regulating seedless phenotype formation in oil palm is very limited so far. In this study, stigma, style, and ovary from seedless and seeded (Tenera and Pisifera) oil palm trees were used to investigate the possible mechanism. Results showed that non-pollination resulted in no fruits, and self- and cross-pollinations resulted in seedless fruits, while boron treatment had no effect on seedless phenotype formation, implying that seedless trees have incomplete self and outcrossing incompatibility. Furthermore, the transcriptome data analysis highlighted eight programmed cell death (PCD) genes and three groups of PCD-related genes: 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (4CL), S-RNase, and MADS-box. The majority of these genes were significantly up-regulated in the stigma and style of Seedless palm trees compared to Tenera and Pisifera. In addition, the co-expression network analysis confirmed the significant correlation among these genes. Moreover, two simple sequence repeats (SSR) markers (S41 and S44) were developed to identify the seedless phenotype. The up-regulation of 4CL and MADS-box TFs activated the expression of PCD genes; on the other hand, S-RNase resulted in pollen tube RNA degradation and triggered PCD. While the link between PCD and seedless phenotype formation in oil palm has not been extensively studied to date, these findings suggest a role of PCD in pollen tube lethality, leading to double fertilization failure and the seedless phenotype.

AB  - Unlike the flower of the model monocot rice, which has diverged greatly from the ancestral monocot flower, the pineapple (Ananas comosus) flower is more typical of monocot flowers. Here, we identified 43 pineapple genes containing MADS-box domains, including 11 type I and 32 type II genes. RNA-seq expression data generated from five pineapple floral organs (sepals, petals, stamens, pistils, and ovules) and quantitative real-time PCR revealed tissue-specific expression patterns for some genes. We found that AcAGL6 and AcFUL1 were mainly expressed in sepals and petals, suggesting their involvement in the regulation of these floral organs. A pineapple 'ABCDE' model was proposed based on the phylogenetic analysis and expression patterns of MADS-box genes. Unlike rice and orchid with frequent species-specific gene duplication and subsequent expression divergence, the composition and expression of the ABCDE genes were conserved in pineapple. We also found that AcSEP1/3, AcAG, AcAGL11a/b/c, and AcFUL1 were highly expressed at different stages of fruit development and have similar expression profiles, implicating these genes' role in fruit development and ripening processes. We propose that the pineapple flower can be used as a model for studying the ancestral form of monocot flowers to investigate their development and evolutionary history.

AB  - MADS-box genes comprise a large family of transcription factors that play crucial roles in all aspects of plant growth and development. However, no detailed information on the evolutionary relationship and functional characterization of MADS-box genes is currently available for some representative lineages, such as the Camellia plant. In this study, 136 MADS-box genes were detected from a reference genome of the tea plant (Camellia sinensis) by employing a 569 bp HMM (Hidden Markov Model) developed using nucleotide sequencing including 73 type I and 63 type II genes. An additional twenty-seven genes were identified, with five MIKC-type genes. Truncated and/or inaccurate gene models were manually verified and curated to improve their functional characterization. Subsequently, phylogenetic relationships, chromosome locations, conserved motifs, gene structures, and gene expression profiles were systematically investigated. Tea plant MIKC genes were divided into all 14 major eudicot subfamilies, and no gene was found in Mbeta. The expansion of MADS-box genes in the tea plant was mainly contributed by WGD/fragment and tandem duplications. The expression profiles of tea plant MADS-box genes in different tissues and seasons were analyzed, revealing widespread evolutionary conservation and genetic redundancy. The expression profiles linked to cold stress treatments suggested the wide involvement of MADS-box genes from the tea plant in response to low temperatures. Moreover, a floral 'ABCE' model was proposed in the tea plant and proved to be both conserved and ancient. Our analyses offer a detailed overview of MADS-box genes in the tea plant, allowing us to hypothesize the potential functions of unknown genes and providing a foundation for further functional characterizations.

AB  - The timing of flowering is pivotal for maximizing reproductive success under fluctuating environmental conditions. Flowering time is tightly controlled by complex genetic networks that integrate endogenous and exogenous cues, such as light, temperature, photoperiod, and hormones. Here, we show that AGAMOUS-LIKE16 (AGL16) and its negative regulator microRNA824 (miR824) control flowering time in Arabidopsis thaliana. Knockout of AGL16 effectively accelerates flowering in nonvernalized Col-FRI, in which the floral inhibitor FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) is strongly expressed, but shows no effect if plants are vernalized or grown in short days. Alteration of AGL16 expression levels by manipulating miR824 abundance influences the timing of flowering quantitatively, depending on the expression level and number of functional FLC alleles. The effect of AGL16 is fully dependent on the presence of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT). Further experiments show that AGL16 can interact directly with SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE and indirectly with FLC, two proteins that form a complex to repress expression of FT. Our data reveal that miR824 and AGL16 modulate the extent of flowering time repression in a long-day photoperiod.

AB  - Floral patterning is regulated by intricate networks of floral identity genes. The peculiar MADS32 subfamily genes, absent in eudicots but prevalent in monocots, control floral organ identity. However, how the MADS32 family genes interact with other floral homeotic genes during flower development is mostly unknown. We show here that the rice homeotic transcription factor OsMADS32 regulates floral patterning by interacting synergistically with E class protein OsMADS6 in a dosage-dependent manner. Furthermore, our results indicate important roles for OsMADS32 in defining stamen, pistil, and ovule development through physical and genetic interactions with OsMADS1, OsMADS58, and OsMADS13, and in specifying floral meristem identity with OsMADS6, OsMADS3, and OsMADS58, respectively. Our findings suggest that OsMADS32 is an important factor for floral meristem identity maintenance and that it integrates the action of other MADS-box homeotic proteins to sustain floral organ specification and development in rice. Given that OsMADS32 is an orphan gene and absent in eudicots, our data substantially expand our understanding of flower development in plants.

AB  - All-flesh tomato cultivars are devoid of locular gel and exhibit enhanced firmness and improved postharvest storage. Here, we show that SlMBP3 is a master regulator of locular tissue in tomato fruit and that a deletion at the gene locus underpins the All-flesh trait. Intriguingly, All-flesh varieties lack the deleterious phenotypes reported previously for SlMBP3 under-expressing lines and which preclude any potential commercial use. We resolve the causal factor for this phenotypic divergence through the discovery of a natural mutation at the SlAGL11 locus, a close homolog of SlMBP3. Misexpressing SlMBP3 impairs locular gel formation through massive transcriptomic reprogramming at initial phases of fruit development. SlMBP3 influences locule gel formation by controlling cell cycle and cell expansion genes, indicating that important components of fruit softening are determined at early pre-ripening stages. Our findings define potential breeding targets for improved texture in tomato and possibly other fleshy fruits.

AB  - MADS-box transcription factors are key elements of the genetic networks controlling flower and fruit development. Among these, the class D clade gathers AGAMOUS-like genes which are involved in seed, ovule, and funiculus development. The tomato genome comprises two class D genes, Sl-AGL11 and Sl-MBP3, both displaying high expression levels in seeds and in central tissues of young fruits. The potential effects of Sl-AGL11 on fruit development were addressed through RNAi silencing and ectopic expression strategies. Sl-AGL11-down-regulated tomato lines failed to show obvious phenotypes except a slight reduction in seed size. In contrast, Sl-AGL11 overexpression triggered dramatic modifications of flower and fruit structure that include: the conversion of sepals into fleshy organs undergoing ethylene-dependent ripening, a placenta hypertrophy to the detriment of locular space, starch and sugar accumulation, and an extreme softening that occurs well before the onset of ripening. RNA-Seq transcriptomic profiling highlighted substantial metabolic reprogramming occurring in sepals and fruits, with major impacts on cell wall-related genes. While several Sl-AGL11-related phenotypes are reminiscent of class C MADS-box genes (TAG1 and TAGL1), the modifications observed on the placenta and cell wall and the Sl-AGL11 expression pattern suggest an action of this class D MADS-box factor on early fleshy fruit development.

AB  - By microarray analysis and real-time RT-PCR, we identified 28 soybean flower-enriched transcription factors such as MADS-box proteins, zinc finger proteins, and MYB proteins. Among them, one MADS-box protein GmSEP1 was chosen for further analysis. GmSEP1 contains 8 exons and 7 introns, showing similar exon-intron structure with Arabidopsis SEP genes. Phylogenetic analysis also suggested that GmSEP1 belonged to AGL2/SEP subfamily and likely a soybean orthologue of Arabidopsis SEP1. Subcellular localization assay suggested that GmSEP1 was localized in nucleus. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR showed that GmSEP1 was predominantly expressed in reproductive organs including petal, sepal, stamen, carpel and seed. By real-time RT-PCR, we found that GmSEP1 was expressed with a low level in stamens of soybean mutant NJS-10Hfs in which some stamens are converted to petal-like structure. Further we found that expression of GmSEP1 was altered during the course of seed development and more accumulated in outer and inner integuments, epidermis and endothelium at the globular stage, heart stage and cotyledon stage and in seed coat parenchyma at the early maturation stage of seed development. Taken together, GmSEP1 might play important role in soybean reproductive development, in particular, in petal and seed coat development.

AB  - MADS-box genes form a large gene family in plants and are involved in multiple biological processes, such as flowering. However, the regulation mechanism of MADS-box genes in flowering remains unresolved, especially under short-term cold conditions. In the present study, we isolated BcMAF1, a Pak-choi (Brassica rapa ssp. Chinensis) MADS AFFECTING FLOWERING (MAF), as a floral repressor and functionally characterized BcMAF1 in Arabidopsis and Pak-choi. Subcellular localization and sequence analysis indicated that BcMAF1 was a nuclear protein and contained a conserved MADS-box domain. Expression analysis revealed that BcMAF1 had higher expression levels in leaves, stems, and petals, and could be induced by short-term cold conditions in Pak-choi. Overexpressing BcMAF1 in Arabidopsis showed that BcMAF1 had a negative function in regulating flowering, which was further confirmed by silencing endogenous BcMAF1 in Pak-choi. In addition, qPCR results showed that AtAP3 expression was reduced and AtMAF2 expression was induced in BcMAF1-overexpressing Arabidopsis. Meanwhile, BcAP3 transcript was up-regulated and BcMAF2 transcript was down-regulated in BcMAF1-silencing Pak-choi. Yeast one-hybrid and dual luciferase transient assays showed that BcMAF1 could bind to the promoters of BcAP3 and BcMAF2. These results indicated that BcAP3 and BcMAF2 might be the targets of BcMAF1. Taken together, our results suggested that BcMAF1 could negatively regulate flowering by directly activating BcMAF2 and repressing BcAP3.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The MADS-box transcription factors play fundamental roles in reproductive developmental control. Although the roles of many plant MADS-box proteins have been extensively studied, there are almost no functional studies of them in soybean, an important protein and oil crop in the world. In addition, the MADS-box protein orthologs may have species-specific functions. Controlling male fertility is an important goal in plant hybrid breeding but is difficult in some crops like soybean. The morphological structure of soybean flowers prevents the cross-pollination. Understanding the molecular mechanisms for floral development will aid in engineering new sterile materials that could be applied in hybrid breeding programs in soybean. RESULT: Through microarray analysis, a flower-enriched gene in soybean was selected and designated as GmMADS28. GmMADS28 belongs to AGL9/SEP subfamily of MADS-box proteins, localized in nucleus and showed specific expression patterns in floral meristems as well as stamen and petal primordia. Expression of GmMADS28 in the stamens and petals of a soybean mutant NJS-10Hfs whose stamens are converted into petals was higher than in those of wild-type plants. Constitutive expression of GmMADS28 in tobacco promoted early flowering and converted stamens and sepals to petals. Interestingly, transgenic plants increased the numbers of sepal, petal and stamen from five to six and exhibited male sterility due to the shortened and curly filaments and the failure of pollen release from the anthers. The ectopic expression of GmMADS28 was found to be sufficient to activate expression of tobacco homologs of SOC1, LEAFY, AGL8/FUL, and DEF. In addition, we observed the interactions of GmMADS28 with soybean homologs of SOC1, AP1, and AGL8/FUL proteins. CONCLUSION: In this study, we observed the roles of GmMADS28 in the regulation of floral organ number and petal identity. Compared to other plant AGL9/SEP proteins, GmMADS28 specifically regulates floral organ number, filament length and pollen release. The sterility caused by the ectopic expression of GmMADS28 offers a promising way to genetically produce new sterile material that could potentially be applied in the hybrid breeding of crops like soybean.

AB  - Stamen development is an important developmental process controlled by multiple internal and external factors. Developmental abnormalities of stamens can disrupt the structure and function of anthers, and then result in male sterility. As well known, APETELA 3 (AP3) has a clear function in regulating stamen development, which may impact in male sterility. However, the mechanisms of stamen development and male sterility controlled by AP3 are still not very clear, particular in Pak-choi (Brassica rapa ssp. chinensis). In this work, BcAP3 encoded a protein containing a MADS-box domain, which was a homolog of AtAP3, was identified in Pak-choi. Sequence alignments and phylogenetic analysis indicated that BcAP3 was highly similar to AtAP3. BcAP3 was shown to be localized to the nucleus and exhibited the potential of transcription factor. The transcript of BcAP3 was only expressed in flowers of Pak-choi, indicating that it may act in flower development. Overexpression of BcAP3 in Arabidopsis resulted in developmental abnormalities of anther wall and low vigor pollen, which were associated with the phenotype of male sterility. Expression levels of NST1 and NST2, involved in secondary wall thickening in anther walls, were significantly higher in the BcAP3-transgenic plants than in control plants, suggesting that BcAP3 may affect anther wall development by regulating NST1 and NST2. Taken together, our study demonstrated that BcAP3 could play an essential role in stamen development and male sterility.

AB  - The Arabidopsis AGL3 gene was previously identified on the basis of sequence similarity to the floral homeotic gene AGAMOUS (AG), which encodes a protein with a conserved MADS domain that is also found in human and yeast transcription factors (SRF and MCM1, respectively). Analysis of newly isolated full-length cDNA clones as well as genomic clones indicates that AGL3 is indeed a MADS-box gene with a general intron-exon structure similar to other plant MADS-box genes. However, unlike the others, which are expressed specifically in flowers, AGL3 is expressed in all above-ground vegetative organs, as well as in flowers, but not in roots. Furthermore, since AGL3 is MADS-domain protein, it is likely that it is also a DNA-binding protein regulating transcription. To characterize AGL3 as a DNA-binding protein in vitro, we expressed the AGL3 protein in Escherichia coli, and characterized its DNA-binding properties. We show that AGL3 binds to sequences which resemble the target sequences of SRF and MCM1, and have determined the consensus sequence to which AGL3 binds using random oligonucleotides. These results suggest that AGL3 is a widely distributed DNA-binding protein, which may be involved the transcriptional regulation of genes in many cells.

AB  - Plants can record external stimuli in mobile mRNAs and systemically deliver them to distal tissues to adjust development. Despite the identification of thousands of mobile mRNAs, the functional relevance of mobile mRNAs remains limited. Many mobile mRNAs are synthesized in the source cells that perceive environmental stimuli, but specifically exert their functions upon transportation to the recipient cells. However, the translation of mobile mRNA-encoded protein in the source cells could locally activate downstream target genes. How plants avoid ectopic functions of mobile mRNAs in the source cells to achieve tissue specificity remains to be elucidated. Here, we show that Arabidopsis AGAMOUS-LIKE 24 (AGL24) is a mobile mRNA whose movement is necessary and sufficient to specify floral organ identity. Although AGL24 mRNA is expressed in vegetative tissues, AGL24 protein exclusively accumulates in the shoot apex. In leaves, AGL24 proteins are degraded to avoid ectopically activating its downstream target genes. Our results reveal how selective protein degradation in source cells provides a strategy to limit the local effects associated with proteins encoded by mobile mRNAs, which ensures that mobile mRNAs specifically trigger systemic responses only in recipient tissues.

AB  - MADS genes encode a family of transcription factors, some of which control the identities of floral organs in flowering plants. Most of the MADS-box genes in fern have been cloned and analyzed in model plants, such as Ceratopteris richardii and Ceratopteris pteridoides. In this study, a new MADS-box gene, DfMADS1(GU385475), was cloned from Dryopteris fragrans (L.) Schott to better understand the role of MADS genes in the evolution of floral organs. The full-length DfMADS1 cDNA was 973 bp in length with a 75 bp 5'-UTR and a 169 bp 3'-UTR. The DfMADS1 protein was predicted to contain a typical MIKC-type domain structure consisting of a MADS domain, a short I region, a K domain, and a C-terminal region. The DfMADS1 protein showed high homology with MADS box proteins from other ferns. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that DfMADS1 belongs to the CRM1-like subfamily. RT-PCR analysis indicated that DfMADS1 is expressed in both the gametophytes and the sporophytes of D. fragrans.

AB  - Plant floral organ development is orchestrated by master regulatory genes that control the differentiation of meristem tissue. According to the ABC(DE) model of flower development (Bowman et al., 1989; nicely summarized by Irish, 2017), different floral organs form in concentric whorls (verticils) in response to the expression of different classes of homeotic genes. As per this model, A- and E-class genes specify sepals in the first whorl; A-, B-, and E-class genes specify petal identity in the second whorl; B-, C-, and E-class genes specify stamen identify in the third whorl; and in the fourth whorl carpel identity is specified by C- and E-class genes. All except one of the ABCDE gene classes specify MADS-box transcription factors (TFs). According to the “floral quartet” or “combinatorial assembly” model (Theißen et al., 2016), different MADS-box proteins interact with one another to form tetrameric protein complexes, with the specific composition determining which DNA sequences they bind with and thus how they regulate gene expression. For instance, stamen identity, specified by B-, C-, and E-class MADS-box TFs, requires the formation of B/C/E tetramers containing B-, C-, and E-class subunits (Theißen et al., 2016). This model explains the fine control over flower shape and development via the development of novel tetramer composition. However, despite its intuitive appeal, and evidence from protein–protein interaction studies that agree with its predictions, the implications of the floral quartet model have not been extensively tested in planta.

AB  - Anomalous flowering of the Antirrhinum majus mutant squamosa (squa) is characterized by excessive formation of bracts and the production of relatively few and often malformed or incomplete flowers. To study the function of squamosa in the commitment of an inflorescence lateral meristem to floral development, the gene was cloned and its genomic structure, a well as that of four mutant alleles, was determined. SQUA is a member of a family of transcription factors which contain the MADS-box, a conserved DNA binding domain. In addition, we analysed the temporal and spatial expression pattern of the squa gene. Low transcriptional activity of squa is detectable in bracts and in the leaves immediately below the inflorescence. High squa transcript levels are seen in the inflorescence lateral meristems as soon as they are formed in the axils of bracts. Squa transcriptional activity persists through later stages of floral morphogenesis, with the exception of stamen differentiation. Although necessary for shaping a normal racemose inflorescence, the squa function is not absolutely essential for flower development. We discuss the function of the gene during flowering, its likely functional redundancy and its possible interaction with other genes participating in the genetic control of flower formation in Antirrhinum.

AB  - Over the last decade, the yeast two-hybrid system has become the tool to use for the identification of protein-protein interactions and recently, even complete interactomes were elucidated by this method. Nevertheless, it is an artificial system that is sensitive to errors resulting in the identification of false-positive and false-negative interactions. In this study, plant MADS box transcription factor interactions identified by yeast two-hybrid systems where studied in living plant cells by a technique based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Petunia MADS box proteins were fused to either cyan fluorescent protein or yellow fluorescent protein and transiently expressed in protoplasts followed by FRET-spectral imaging microscopy and FRET-fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy to detect FRET and hence protein-protein interactions. All petunia MADS box heterodimers identified in yeast were confirmed in protoplasts. However, in contrast to the yeast two-hybrid results, homodimerization was demonstrated in plant cells for three petunia MADS box proteins. Heterodimers were identified between the ovule-specific MADS box protein FLORAL BINDING PROTEIN 11 and members of the petunia FLORAL BINDING PROTEIN 2 subfamily, which are also expressed in ovules, suggesting that these dimers play a role in ovule development. Furthermore, the role of dimerization in translocation of MADS box protein dimers to the nucleus is demonstrated, and the nuclear localization signal of MADS box proteins has been mapped to the N-terminal region of the MADS domain by means of mutant analyses.

AB  - We have identified a novel petunia MADS box gene, PETUNIA FLOWERING GENE (PFG), which is involved in the transition from vegetative to reproductive development. PFG is expressed in the entire plant except stamens, roots and seedlings. Highest expression levels of PFG are found in vegetative and inflorescence meristems. Inhibition of PFG expression in transgenic plants, using a cosuppression strategy, resulted in a unique nonflowering phenotype. Homozygous pfg cosuppression plants are blocked in the formation of inflorescences and maintain vegetative growth. In these mutants, the expression of both PFG and the MADS box gene FLORAL BINDING PROTEIN26 (FBP26), the putative petunia homolog of SQUAMOSA from Antirrhinum, are down-regulated. In hemizygous pfg cosuppression plants initially a few flowers are formed, after which the meristem reverts to the vegetative phase. This reverted phenotype suggests that PFG, besides being required for floral transition, is also required to maintain the reproductive identity after this transition. The position of PFG in the hierarchy of genes controlling floral meristem development was investigated using a double mutant of the floral meristem identity mutant aberrant leaf and flower (alf) and the pfg cosuppression mutant. This analysis revealed that the pfg cosuppression phenotype is epistatic to the alf mutant phenotype, indicating that PFG acts early in the transition to flowering. These results suggest that the petunia MADS box gene, PFG, functions as an inflorescence meristem identity gene required for the transition of the vegetative shoot apex to the reproductive phase and the maintenance of reproductive identity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Plant MADS box proteins play important roles in a plethora of developmental processes. In order to regulate specific sets of target genes, MADS box proteins dimerize and are thought to assemble into multimeric complexes. In this study a large-scale yeast three-hybrid screen is utilized to provide insight into the higher-order complex formation capacity of the Arabidopsis MADS box family. SEPALLATA3 (SEP3) has been shown to mediate complex formation and, therefore, special attention is paid to this factor in this study. RESULTS: In total, 106 multimeric complexes were identified; in more than half of these at least one SEP protein was present. Besides the known complexes involved in determining floral organ identity, various complexes consisting of combinations of proteins known to play a role in floral organ identity specification, and flowering time determination were discovered. The capacity to form this latter type of complex suggests that homeotic factors play essential roles in down-regulation of the MADS box genes involved in floral timing in the flower via negative auto-regulatory loops. Furthermore, various novel complexes were identified that may be important for the direct regulation of the floral transition process. A subsequent detailed analysis of the APETALA3, PISTILLATA, and SEP3 proteins in living plant cells suggests the formation of a multimeric complex in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these results provide strong indications that higher-order complex formation is a general and essential molecular mechanism for plant MADS box protein functioning and attribute a pivotal role to the SEP3 'glue' protein in mediating multimerization.

AB  - Transcription factors (TFs) regulate gene expression to control certain genetic programs, such as growth and development, phytohormone regulation, and environmental stresses. 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (2-AP) is the key element involved in aroma biosynthesis pathway, and the application of micronutrients can increase the 2-AP levels. However, little is known about the micronutrient-induced TFs involved in 2-AP biosynthesis. Here, we identify a number of TF families in two fragrant rice varieties, "Meixiangzhan-2" (M) and "Xiangyaxiangzhan" (X), in response to Zinc (Zn) application through transcriptomic analysis. A total of ~678 TFs were identified and grouped into 26 TF families, each of which was found to be involved in numerous signaling pathways. The WRKY TF family was found to be the most abundant, followed by bHLH and MYB. Furthermore, members of the WRKY, bHLH, MYB, ERF, HSF, MADS-box, NFY, and AP2 TF families were significantly upregulated and may be involved in the transcriptional regulation of aroma biosynthesis. In brief, this study enhances our understanding of the molecular mechanism of 2-AP biosynthesis and highlights the key TFs potentially involved in the production of aroma in fragrant rice.

AB  - alpha-Mannosidase (alpha-Man), a fruit ripening-specific N-glycan processing enzyme, is involved in ripening-associated fruit softening process. However, the regulation of fruit-ripening specific expression of alpha-Man is not well understood. We have identified and functionally characterized the promoter of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) alpha-Man to provide molecular insights into its transcriptional regulation during fruit ripening. Fruit ripening-specific activation of the alpha-Man promoter was revealed by analysing promoter driven expression of beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter in transgenic tomato. We found that RIPENING INHIBITOR (RIN), a MADS box family transcription factor acts as positive transcriptional regulator of alpha-Man during fruit ripening. RIN directly bound to the alpha-Man promoter sequence and promoter activation/alpha-Man expression was compromised in rin mutant fruit. Deletion analysis revealed that a promoter fragment (567 bp upstream of translational start site) that contained three CArG boxes (binding sites for RIN) was sufficient to drive GUS expression in fruits. In addition, alpha-Man expression was down-regulated in fruits of Nr mutant which is impaired in ethylene perception and promoter activation/alpha-Man expression was induced in wild type following treatment with a precursor of ethylene biosynthesis, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC). Although, alpha-Man expression was induced in rin mutant after ACC treatment, the transcript level was less as compared to ACC-treated wild type. Taken together, these results suggest RIN-mediated direct transcriptional regulation of alpha-Man during fruit ripening and ethylene may acts in RIN-dependent and -independent ways to regulate alpha-Man expression.

AB  - In angiosperms, interspecific crosses often display hybrid incompatibilities that are manifested as under-proliferation or over-proliferation of endosperm. Recent analyses using crosses between Arabidopsis thaliana and its related species with different ploidy levels have shown that interspecific hybridization causes delayed developmental transition and increased mitotic activity in the endosperm. In this study, we investigated endosperm development in interspecific crosses between diploid Oryza species. In a cross between female O. sativa and male O. punctata, we found that the hybrid endosperm was reduced in size and this cross was associated with precocious developmental transition. By contrast, the cross between O. sativa and O. longistaminata generated enlarged hybrid endosperm at the mid-point of seed development and this cross was associated with delayed developmental transition. Subsequently, the hybrid endosperm displayed a shriveled appearance at the seed maturation stage. We found that the accumulation of storage products and the expression patterns of several marker genes were also altered in the hybrid endosperm. By contrast, the rate of syncytial mitotic nuclear divisions was not significantly affected. The gene OsMADS87 showed a maternal origin-specific expression pattern in rice endosperm, in contrast to its Arabidopsis homologue PHERES1, which shows paternal origin-specific expression. OsMADS87 expression was decreased or increased depending on the type of developmental transition change in the hybrid rice endosperm. Our results indicate that one of the interspecies hybridization barriers in Oryza endosperm is mediated by precocious or delayed developmental alterations and de-regulation of OsMADS87, without change to the rate of syncytial mitotic nuclear division in the hybrid endosperm.

AB  - The regulation of ripening in fleshy fruits directly affects the quality and shelf life of such fruit, and extensive research has aimed to understand this regulation based on its agronomic importance. The identification of the key regulatory gene RIN in tomato has opened new horizons in our understanding of fruit ripening. RIN encodes a MADS-box transcription factor that functions as one of the earliest acting factors in the induction of ripening, and the molecular characterization of RIN has helped to elucidate the regulation of fruit ripening. Here I will review current advances in our understanding of the mechanisms that regulate fruit ripening in tomato, including the roles of RIN and other MADS-box proteins, mainly based on our recent studies. First, examination of the molecular properties of the RIN protein revealed that RIN has activities similar to SEPALLATA type MADS-box proteins. Next, identification of the direct transcriptional targets of RIN, via chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, demonstrated that RIN directly regulates a broad range of ripening-associated genes. Finally, identification of MADS-box proteins that interact with RIN revealed the functions of these proteins in ripening regulation. These studies clearly demonstrate the essential roles of MADS-box proteins in the regulation of tomato fruit ripening.

AB  - The tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) ripening inhibitor (rin) mutation completely represses fruit ripening, as rin fruits fail to express ripening-associated genes and remain green and firm. Moreover, heterozygous rin fruits (rin/+) ripen normally but have extended shelf life, an important consideration for this perishable fruit crop; therefore, heterozygous rin has been widely used to breed varieties that produce red tomatoes with improved shelf life. We previously used CRISPR/Cas9 to produce novel alleles at the rin locus. The wild-type allele RIN encodes a MADS-box transcription factor and the novel allele, named as rinG2, generates an early stop codon, resulting in C-terminal truncation of the transcription factor. Like rin fruits, rinG2 fruits exhibit extended shelf life, but unlike rin fruits, which remain yellow-green even after long-term storage, rinG2 fruits turn orange due to ripening-associated carotenoid production. Here, to explore the potential of the rinG2 mutation for breeding, we characterized the effects of rinG2 in the heterozygous state (rinG2/+) compared to the effects of rin/+. The softening of rinG2/+ fruits was delayed compared to the wild type but to a lesser degree than rin/+ fruits. Lycopene and beta-carotene levels in rinG2/+ fruits were similar to those of the wild type, whereas rin/+ fruits accumulated half the amount of beta-carotene compared to the wild type. The rinG2/+ fruits produced lower levels of ethylene than wild-type and rin/+ fruits. Expression analysis revealed that in rinG2/+ fruits, the rinG2 mutation (like rin) partially inhibited the expression of ripening-associated genes. The small differences in the inhibitory effects of rinG2 vs. rin coincided with small differences in phenotypes, such as ethylene production, softening, and carotenoid accumulation. Therefore, rinG2 represents a promising genetic resource for developing tomato cultivars with extended shelf life.

AB  - Flower malformation represented by phyllody is a common symptom of phytoplasma infection induced by a novel family of phytoplasma effectors called phyllogens. Despite the accumulation of functional and structural phyllogen information, the molecular mechanisms of phyllody have not yet been integrated with their evolutionary aspects due to the limited data on their homologs across diverse phytoplasma lineages. Here, we developed a novel universal PCR-based approach to identify 25 phytoplasma phyllogens related to nine "Candidatus Phytoplasma" species, including four species whose phyllogens have not yet been identified. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the phyllogen family consists of four groups (phyl-A, -B, -C, and -D) and that the evolutionary relationships of phyllogens were significantly distinct from those of phytoplasmas, suggesting that phyllogens were transferred horizontally among phytoplasma strains and species. Although phyllogens belonging to the phyl-A, -C, and -D groups induced phyllody, the phyl-B group lacked the ability to induce phyllody. Comparative functional analyses of phyllogens revealed that a single amino acid polymorphism in phyl-B group phyllogens prevented interactions between phyllogens and A- and E-class MADS domain transcription factors (MTFs), resulting in the inability to degrade several MTFs and induce phyllody. Our finding of natural variation in the function of phytoplasma effectors provides new insights into molecular mechanisms underlying the aetiology of phytoplasma diseases.

AB  - Anthocyanins are important health-promoting phytochemicals that are abundant in many fleshy fruits. Bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) is one of the best sources of these compounds. Here, we report on the expression pattern and functional analysis of a SQUAMOSA-class MADS box transcription factor, VmTDR4, associated with anthocyanin biosynthesis in bilberry. Levels of VmTDR4 expression were spatially and temporally linked with color development and anthocyanin-related gene expression. Virus-induced gene silencing was used to suppress VmTDR4 expression in bilberry, resulting in substantial reduction in anthocyanin levels in fully ripe fruits. Chalcone synthase was used as a positive control in the virus-induced gene silencing experiments. Additionally, in sectors of fruit tissue in which the expression of the VmTDR4 gene was silenced, the expression of R2R3 MYB family transcription factors related to the biosynthesis of flavonoids was also altered. We conclude that VmTDR4 plays an important role in the accumulation of anthocyanins during normal ripening in bilberry, probably through direct or indirect control of transcription factors belonging to the R2R3 MYB family.

AB  - Mutations in the APETALA3 (AP3) gene of A. thaliana result in homeotic transformations of petals to sepals and stamens to carpels. We have cloned the AP3 gene from Arabidopsis based on its homology to the homeotic flower gene deficiens (DEFA) from the distantly related plant Antirrhinum majus. The sequence of four ap3 mutant alleles and genetic mapping analysis prove that the DEFA homolog is AP3. Like several other plant homeotic genes, the AP3 gene contains a MADS box and likely acts as a transcription factor. The region-specific spatial expression pattern of AP3 rules out certain types of sequential models of flower development and argues in favor of a spatial model based on positional information. Since DEFA and AP3 have very similar protein products, mutant phenotypes, and spatial expression patterns, it is likely that these genes are cognate homologs.

AB  - MADS-box proteins are a large family of transcription factors. In plants, many genes belonging to this family are involved in the homeosis of the floral system. Up to now, they have mainly been studied in angiosperms, especially in the model species Arabidopsis thaliana and Antirrhinum majus. We undertook a study of MADS-box genes in Ginkgo biloba, the unique extant representative of a whole branch of the phylogenetic tree of the seed plants. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) survey reveals the diversity of MADS-box genes present in the genome of the Ginkgo. Duplications probably occurred specifically in the ginkgophyte lineage. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that one of these genes, GBM5, is an orthologue of the AGAMOUS gene of A. thaliana. We cloned and sequenced the entire cDNA of the GBM5 gene and studied its intron/exon structure. We showed by reverse transcriptase-PCR that it is expressed in both floral and vegetative tissues. We discuss the molecular evolution of the AGAMOUS family of genes.

AB  - The mantled floral phenotype of oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) affects somatic embryogenesis-derived individuals and is morphologically similar to mutants defective in the B-class MADS-box genes. This somaclonal variation has been previously demonstrated to be associated to a significant deficit in genome-wide DNA methylation. In order to elucidate the possible role of DNA methylation in the transcriptional regulation of EgDEF1, the APETALA3 ortholog of oil palm, we studied this epigenetic mark within the gene in parallel with transcript accumulation in both normal and mantled developing inflorescences. We also examined the methylation and expression of two neighboring retrotransposons that might interfere with EgDEF1 regulation. We show that the EgDEF1 gene is essentially unmethylated and that its methylation pattern does not change with the floral phenotype whereas expression is dramatically different, ruling out a direct implication of DNA methylation in the regulation of this gene. Also, we find that both the gypsy element inserted within an intron of the EgDEF1 gene and the copia element located upstream from the promoter are heavily methylated and show little or no expression. Interestingly, we identify a shorter, alternative transcript produced by EgDEF1 and characterize its accumulation with respect to its full-length counterpart. We demonstrate that, depending on the floral phenotype, the respective proportions of these two transcripts change differently during inflorescence development. We discuss the possible phenotypical consequences of this alternative splicing and the new questions it raises in the search for the molecular mechanisms underlying the mantled phenotype in the oil palm.

AB  - Genome-wide transcriptome profiling is a powerful tool to study global gene expression patterns in plant development. We report the first transcriptome profile analysis of papaya embryogenic callus to improve our understanding on genes associated with somatic embryogenesis. By using 3' mRNA-sequencing, we generated 6,190,687 processed reads and 47.0% were aligned to papaya genome reference, in which 21,170 (75.4%) of 27,082 annotated genes were found to be expressed but only 41% was expressed at functionally high levels. The top 10% of genes with high transcript abundance were significantly enriched in biological processes related to cell proliferation, stress response, and metabolism. Genes functioning in somatic embryogenesis such as SERK and LEA, hormone-related genes, stress-related genes, and genes involved in secondary metabolite biosynthesis pathways were highly expressed. Transcription factors such as NAC, WRKY, MYB, WUSCHEL, Agamous-like MADS-box protein and bHLH important in somatic embryos of other plants species were found to be expressed in papaya embryogenic callus. Abundant expression of enolase and ADH is consistent with proteome study of papaya somatic embryo. Our study highlights that some genes related to secondary metabolite biosynthesis, especially phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, were highly expressed in papaya embryogenic callus, which might have implication for cell factory applications. The discovery of all genes expressed in papaya embryogenic callus provides an important information into early biological processes during the induction of embryogenesis and useful for future research in other plant species.

AB  - MADS-box genes encode regulatory factors that are involved at various stages in plant development. These genes function not only during early floral meristem identity, but also when the fate of floral organ primordia is determined in a later step. Here, we screened a floral bud cDNA library to isolate a tobacco MADS-box gene, NtMADS4, using the rice MADS-box gene, OsMADS1, as a probe. We previously reported that OsMADS1 plays a critical role in flower development in rice. Ectopic expression of NtMADS4 caused phenotypes of extremely early flowering as well as dwarfism. Plant MADS proteins have a K domain that mediates the formation of dimers. This dimerization appears to be an essential step for a functional protein complex. NtMADS11 was isolated as an interacting partner of NtMADS4 by yeast two-hybrid screening. The latter was included in the AGAMOUS-like 2 (AGL2) family whereas the former was categorized in the SQUAMOSA (SQUA) family. While the transcript of NtMADS4 was detectable only in reproductive organs, that of NtMADS11 was seen in both reproductive and vegetative organs. Expression levels were high for both genes during early developmental stages. Ectopic expression of NtMADS11 and OsMADS14 was able to rescue the floral organ defects seen in the strong ap1-1 mutant. Roles of NtMADS4 and NtMADS11 in the floral initiation are discussed.

AB  - Flowering in perennial species is directed via complex signalling pathways that adjust to developmental regulations and environmental cues. Synchronized flowering in certain environments is a prerequisite to commercial seed production, and so the elucidation of the genetic architecture of flowering time in Miscanthus and switchgrass could aid breeding in these underdeveloped species. In this context, we assessed a mapping population in Miscanthus and two ecologically diverse switchgrass mapping populations over 3 years from planting. Multiple flowering time quantitative trait loci (QTL) were identified in both species. Remarkably, the most significant Miscanthus and switchgrass QTL proved to be syntenic, located on linkage groups 4 and 2, with logarithm of odds scores of 17.05 and 21.8 respectively. These QTL regions contained three flowering time transcription factors: Squamosa Promoter-binding protein-Like, MADS-box SEPELLATA2 and gibberellin-responsive bHLH137. The former is emerging as a key component of the age-related flowering time pathway.

AB  - Rice contains several MADS box genes. It has been demonstrated previously that one of these genes, OsMADS1 (for Oryza sativa MADS box gene1), is expressed preferentially in flowers and causes early flowering when ectopically expressed in tobacco plants. In this study, we demonstrated that ectopic expression of OsMADS1 in rice also results in early flowering. To further investigate the role of OsMADS1 during rice flower development, we generated transgenic rice plants expressing altered OsMADS1 genes that contain missense mutations in the MADS domain. There was no visible alteration in the transgenic plants during the vegetative stage. However, transgenic panicles typically exhibited phenotypic alterations, including spikelets consisting of elongated leafy paleae and lemmas that exhibit a feature of open hull, two pairs of leafy palea-like and lemma-like lodicules, a decrease in stamen number, and an increase in the number of carpels. In addition, some spikelets generated an additional floret from the same rachilla. These characteristics are very similar to those of leafy hull sterile1 (lhs1). The map position of OsMADS1 is closely linked to that of lhs1 on chromosome 3. Examination of lhs1 revealed that it contains two missense mutations in the OsMADS1 MADS domain. A genetic complementation experiment showed that the 11.9-kb genomic DNA fragment containing the wild-type OsMADS1 gene rescued the mutant phenotypes. In addition, ectopic expression of the OsMADS1 gene isolated from the lhs1 line resulted in lhs1-conferred phenotypes. These lines of evidence demonstrate that OsMADS1 is the lhs1 gene.

AB  - The SEPALLATA (SEP) genes of Arabidopsis thaliana encode MADS-domain transcription factors that specify the identity of all floral organs. The four Arabidopsis SEP genes function in a largely yet not completely redundant manner. Here, we analysed interactions of the SEP proteins with DNA. All of the proteins were capable of forming tetrameric quartet-like complexes on DNA fragments carrying two sequence elements termed CArG-boxes. Distances between the CArG-boxes for strong cooperative DNA-binding were in the range of 4-6 helical turns. However, SEP1 also bound strongly to CArG-box pairs separated by smaller or larger distances, whereas SEP2 preferred large and SEP4 preferred small inter-site distances for binding. Cooperative binding of SEP3 was comparatively weak for most of the inter-site distances tested. All SEP proteins constituted floral quartet-like complexes together with the floral homeotic proteins APETALA3 (AP3) and PISTILLATA (PI) on the target genes AP3 and SEP3. Our results suggest an important part of an explanation for why the different SEP proteins have largely, but not completely redundant functions in determining floral organ identity: they may bind to largely overlapping, but not identical sets of target genes that differ in the arrangement and spacing of the CArG-boxes in their cis-regulatory regions.

However, the mechanism underlying the regulatory loop involving the membrane-protein targets of RIPENING-INHIBITOR (RIN) remains poorly understood. To unravel the function of tomato ( Solanum lycopersicum) FERONIA Like (SlFERL), a putative MADS-box transcription factor target gene, we investigated and addressed the significance of SlFERL in fruit ripening by combining reverse genetics, biochemical, and cytological analyses. Here, we report that RIN and Tomato AGAMOUS-LIKE1 (TAGL1) directly bind to the promoter region of SlFERL and further activate its expression transcriptionally, suggesting a potential role of SlFERL in fruit ripening. Overexpression of SlFERL significantly accelerated the ripening process of tomato fruit, whereas RNA interference knockdown of SlFERL resulted in delayed fruit ripening. Moreover, a surface plasmon resonance assay coupled with tandem mass spectrometry and a protein interaction assay revealed that SlFERL interacts with the key enzyme S-adenosyl-Met synthetase 1 (SlSAMS1) in the ethylene biosynthesis pathway, leading to increased S-adenosyl-Met accumulation and elevated ethylene production. Thus, SlFERL serves as a positive regulator of ethylene production and fruit ripening. This study provides clues to the molecular regulatory networks underlying fruit ripening.

AB  - BACKGROUND: MADS-box genes are categorized into A, B, C, D and E classes and are involved in floral organ identity and flowering. Sheepgrass (Leymus chinensis (Trin.) Tzvel) is an important perennial forage grass and adapts well to many adverse environments. However, there are few studies on the molecular mechanisms of flower development in sheepgrass, especially studies on MADS-domain proteins. RESULTS: In this study, we cloned 11 MADS-box genes from sheepgrass (Leymus chinensis (Trin.) Tzvel), and phylogenetic analysis of the 11 genes with their homologs revealed that they are divided into nine subclades. Tissue-specific expression profile analysis showed that most of these MADS-box genes were highly expressed in floral organs. LcMADS1 and LcMADS3 showed higher expression in the stamen than in the other tissues, and LcMADS7 showed high expression in the stamen, glume, lemma and palea, while expression of LcMADS2, LcMADS9 and LcMADS11 was higher in vegetative organs than floral organs. Furthermore, yeast two-hybrid analyses showed that LcMADS2 interacted with LcMADS7 and LcMADS9. LcMADS3 interacted with LcMADS4, LcMADS7 and LcMADS10, while LcMADS1 could interact with only LcMADS7. Interestingly, the expression of LcMADS1 and LcMADS2 were significantly induced by cold, and LcMADS9 was significantly up-regulated by NaCl. CONCLUSION: Hence, we proposed that LcMADS1, LcMADS2, LcMADS3, LcMADS7 and LcMADS9 play a pivotal role in sheepgrass sexual reproduction and may be involved in abiotic stress responses, and our findings provide useful information for further exploration of the functions of this gene family in rice, wheat and other graminaceous cereals.

AB  - The timing of flowering and the inflorescence architecture are critical for the reproductive success of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), but the gene regulatory networks underlying these traits have not been fully explored. Here, we show that the tomato FRUITFULL-like (FUL-like) genes FUL2 and MADS-BOX PROTEIN 20 (MBP20) promote the vegetative-to-reproductive transition and repress inflorescence branching by inducing floral meristem (FM) maturation. FUL1 fulfils a less prominent role and appears to depend on FUL2 and MBP20 for its upregulation in the inflorescence- and floral meristems. MBP10, the fourth tomato FUL-like gene, has probably lost its function. The tomato FUL-like proteins cannot homodimerize in in vitro assays, but heterodimerize with various other MADS-domain proteins, potentially forming distinct complexes in the transition meristem and FM. Transcriptome analysis of the primary shoot meristems revealed various interesting downstream targets, including four repressors of cytokinin signaling that are upregulated during the floral transition in ful1 ful2 mbp10 mbp20 mutants. FUL2 and MBP20 can also bind in vitro to the upstream regions of these genes, thereby probably directly stimulating cell division in the meristem upon the transition to flowering. The control of inflorescence branching does not occur via the cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenases (CKXs) but may be regulated by repression of transcription factors such as TOMATO MADS-box gene 3 (TM3) and APETALA 2b (AP2b).

AB  - Flowering plants have evolved different flowering habits to sustain long-term reproduction. Most woody trees experience dormancy and then bloom in the warm spring, but loquat blooms in the cold autumn and winter. To explore its mechanism of flowering regulation, we cloned two SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) homologous genes from 'Jiefanzhong' loquat (Eriobotrya japonica Lindl.), namely, EjSVP1 and EjSVP2. Sequence analysis revealed that the EjSVPs were typical MADS-box transcription factors and exhibited a close genetic relationship with other plant SVP/DORMANCY-ASSOCIATED MADS-BOX (DAM) proteins. The temporal and spatial expression patterns showed that EjSVP1 and EjSVP2 were mainly expressed in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) after the initiation of flowering; after reaching their highest level, they gradually decreased with the development of the flower until they could not be detected. EjSVP1 expression levels were relatively high in young tissues, and EjSVP2 expression levels were relatively high in young to mature transformed tissues. Interestingly, EjSVP2 showed relatively high expression levels in various flower tissues. We analyzed the EjSVP promoter regions and found that they did not contain the C-repeat/dehydration-responsive element. Finally, we overexpressed the EjSVPs in wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 and found no significant changes in the number of rosette leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana; however, overexpression of EjSVP2 affected the formation of Arabidopsis thaliana flower organs. In conclusion, EjSVPs were found to play an active role in the development of loquat flowering. These findings may provide a reference for exploring the regulation mechanisms of loquat flowering and the dormancy mechanisms of other plants.

AB  - The MADS-box transcription factor SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS1 (SOC1) integrates environmental and endogenous signals to promote flowering in Arabidopsis. However, the role of SOC1 homologs in regulating flowering time in fruit trees remains unclear. To better understand the molecular mechanism of flowering regulation in loquat (Eriobotrya japonica Lindl.), two SOC1 homologs (EjSOC1-1 and EjSOC1-2) were identified and characterized in this work. Sequence analysis showed that EjSOC1-1 and EjSOC1-2 have conserved MADS-box and K-box domains. EjSOC1-1 and EjSOC1-2 were clearly expressed in vegetative organs, and high expression was detected in flower buds. As observed in paraffin-embedded sections, expression of the downstream flowering genes EjAP1s and EjLFYs started to increase at the end of June, a time when flower bud differentiation occurs. Additionally, high expression of EjSOC1-1 and EjSOC1-2 began 10 days earlier than that of EjAP1s and EjLFYs in shoot apical meristem (SAM). EjSOC1-1 and EjSOC1-2 were inhibited by short-day (SD) conditions and exogenous GA(3), and flower bud differentiation did not occur after these treatments. EjSOC1-1 and EjSOC1-2 were found to be localized to the nucleus. Moreover, ectopic overexpression of EjSOC1-1 and EjSOC1-2 in wild-type Arabidopsis promoted early flowering, and overexpression of both was able to rescue the late flowering phenotype of the soc1-2 mutant. In conclusion, the results suggest that cultivated loquat flower bud differentiation in southern China begins in late June to early July and that EjSOC1-1 and EjSOC1-2 participate in the induction of flower initiation. These findings provide new insight into the artificial regulation of flowering time in fruit trees.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dormancy associated MADS-box (DAM) genes are candidates for the regulation of growth cessation and terminal bud formation in peach. These genes are not expressed in the peach mutant evergrowing, which fails to cease growth and enter dormancy under dormancy-inducing conditions. We analyzed the phylogenetic relationships among and the rates and patterns of molecular evolution within DAM genes in the phylogenetic context of the MADS-box gene family. RESULTS: The peach DAM genes grouped with the SVP/StMADS11 lineage of type II MIKCC MADS-box genes. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that the peach SVP/StMADS11-like gene family, which contains significantly more members than annual model plants, expanded through serial tandem gene duplication. We found evidence of strong purifying selection acting to constrain functional divergence among the peach DAM genes and only a single codon, located in the C-terminal region, under significant positive selection. CONCLUSION: Because all DAM genes are expressed in peach and are subjected to strong purifying selection we suggest that the duplicated genes have been maintained by subfunctionalization and/or neofunctionalization. In addition, this pattern of selection suggests that the DAM genes are important for peach growth and development.

AB  - Temperature is an important environmental cue that affects flowering time in plants. The MADS-box transcription factor FLOWERING LOCUS M (FLM) forms a heterodimeric complex with SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) and controls ambient temperature-responsive flowering in Arabidopsis. FLM-beta and FLM-delta, two major splice variants produced from the FLM locus, exert opposite effects on flowering, but the molecular mechanism by which the interaction between FLM isoforms and SVP affects temperature-responsive flowering remains poorly understood. Here, we show that FLM-beta and FLM-delta play important roles in modulating the temperature-dependent behavior, conformation, and stability of SVP. Nuclear localization of SVP decreases as temperature increases. FLM-beta is required for SVP nuclear translocation at low temperature, whereas SVP interacts with FLM-delta mainly in the cytoplasm at high temperature. SVP preferentially binds to FLM-beta at low temperature in tobacco leaf cells. SVP shows high binding affinity to FLM-beta at low temperature and to FLM-delta at high temperature. SVP undergoes similar structural changes in the interactions with FLM-beta and FLM-delta; however, FLM-delta likely causes more pronounced conformational changes in the SVP structure. FLM-delta causes rapid degradation of SVP at high temperature, compared with FLM-beta, possibly via ubiquitination. Mutation of lysine 53 or lysine 165 in SVP causes increased abundance of SVP due to reduced ubiquitination of SVP and thus delays flowering at high temperature. Our findings suggest that temperature-dependent differential interactions between SVP and FLM isoforms modulate the temperature-responsive induction of flowering in Arabidopsis.

AB  - AGAMOUS-like 15 (AGL15) is a member of the MADS-domain transcription factor (TF) family. MADS proteins are named for a conserved domain that was originally from an acronym derived from genes expressed in a variety of eukaryotes (MCM1-AGAMOUS-DEFICIENS-SERUM RESPONSE FACTOR). In plants, this family has expanded greatly, with more than one-hundred members generally found in dicots, and the proteins encoded by these genes have often been associated with developmental identity. AGL15 transcript and protein accumulate primarily in embryos and has been found to promote an important process called plant regeneration via somatic embryogenesis (SE). To understand how this TF performs this function, we have previously used microarray technologies to assess direct and indirect responsive targets of this TF. We have now revisited this question using next generation sequencing (NGS) to both characterize in vivo binding sites for AGL15 as well as response to the accumulation of AGL15. We compared these data to the prior microarray results to evaluate the different platforms. The new NGS data brought to light an interaction with brassinosteroid (BR) hormone signaling that was "missed" in prior Gene Ontology analysis from the microarray studies.

AB  - Somatic embryogenesis (SE) is a process by which an embryo is derived from somatic tissue. Transcription factors (TFs) have been identified that control this process. One such TF that promotes SE is AGAMOUS-like 15 (AGL15). Prior work has shown that AGL15 can both induce and repress gene expression. One way this type of dual function TF works is via protein interactions, so a yeast 2-hybrid (Y2H) screen was undertaken. One intriguing protein with which AGL15 interacted in Y2H was LBD40. LBD40 encodes a LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES (LOB)-domain TF that is unique to plants and is primarily expressed during seed development. Here, we confirm the AGL15-LBD40 interaction by quantitative assays and in planta co-immunoprecipation. We also document a role for LBD40, and the closely related protein LBD41, in supporting SE. To determine downstream genes potentially controlled by LBD40, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) was used. More than 400 binding regions for LBD40 were consistently found genome-wide. To determine genes responsive to LBD40/41 accumulation, RNA-seq analysis of transcriptomes of wild-type control and loss-of-function lbd40/lbd41 was performed. Combining these datasets provides insight into genes directly and indirectly controlled by these LOB domain TFs. The gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of these regulated genes showed an overrepresentation of biological processes that are associated with SE, further indicating the importance of LBD40 in SE. This work provides insight into SE, a poorly understood, but essential process to generate transgenic plants to meet agricultural demands or test gene function. This manuscript reports on experiments to understand the role that LDB40, a TF, plays in support of SE by investigating genes directly and indirectly controlled by LBD40 and examining physical and genetic interactions with other TFs active in SE. We uncover targets of LBD40 and an interacting TF of the MADS family and investigate targets involvement in SE.

AB  - AGAMOUS-like 15 (AGL15) is a member of the MADS domain family of transcription factors (TFs) that can directly induce and repress target gene expression, and for which promotion of somatic embryogenesis (SE) is positively correlated with accumulation. An ethylene-responsive element binding factor-associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motif of form LxLxL within the carboxyl-terminal domain of AGL15 was shown to be involved in repression of gene expression. Here, we examine whether AGL15's ability to repress gene expression is needed to promote SE. While a form of AGL15 where the LxLxL is changed to AxAxA can still promote SE, another form with a strong transcriptional activator at the carboxy-terminal end, does not promote SE and, in fact, is detrimental to SE development. Select target genes were examined for response to the different forms of AGL15.

AB  - Plants have amazing regenerative properties with single somatic cells, or groups of cells able to give rise to fully formed plants. One means of regeneration is somatic embryogenesis, by which an embryonic structure is formed that "converts" into a plantlet. Somatic embryogenesis has been used as a model for zygotic processes that are buried within layers of maternal tissues. Understanding mechanisms of somatic embryo induction and development are important as a more accessible model for seed development. We rely on seed development not only for most of our caloric intake, but also as a delivery system for engineered crops to meet agricultural challenges. Regeneration of transformed cells is needed for this applied work as well as basic research to understand gene function. Here we focus on a MADS-domain transcription factor, AGAMOUS-Like15 (AGL15) that shows a positive correlation between accumulation levels and capacity for somatic embryogenesis. We relate AGL15 function to other transcription factors, hormones, and epigenetic modifiers involved in somatic embryo development.

AB  - Salinity is increasingly becoming a significant problem for the most important yet intrinsically salt-sensitive grain legume chickpea. Chickpea is extremely sensitive to salinity during the reproductive phase. Therefore, it is essential to understand the molecular mechanisms by comparing the transcriptomic dynamics between the two contrasting genotypes in response to salt stress. Chickpea exhibits considerable genetic variation amongst improved cultivars, which show better yields in saline conditions but still need to be enhanced for sustainable crop production. Based on previous extensive multi-location physiological screening, two identified genotypes, JG11 (salt-tolerant) and ICCV2 (salt-sensitive), were subjected to salt stress to evaluate their phenological and transcriptional responses. RNA-Sequencing is a revolutionary tool that allows for comprehensive transcriptome profiling to identify genes and alleles associated with stress tolerance and sensitivity. After the first flowering, the whole flower from stress-tolerant and sensitive genotypes was collected. A total of ~300 million RNA-Seq reads were sequenced, resulting in 2022 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in response to salt stress. Genes involved in flowering time such as FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and pollen development such as ABORTED MICROSPORES (AMS), rho-GTPase, and pollen-receptor kinase were significantly differentially regulated, suggesting their role in salt tolerance. In addition to this, we identify a suite of essential genes such as MYB proteins, MADS-box, and chloride ion channel genes, which are crucial regulators of transcriptional responses to salinity tolerance. The gene set enrichment analysis and functional annotation of these genes in flower development suggest that they can be potential candidates for chickpea crop improvement for salt tolerance.

AB  - To elucidate the molecular mechanism of juvenility and annual flowering of fruit trees, FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), an integrator of flowering signals, was investigated in apple as a model. We performed sequence and expression analyses and transgenic experiments related to juvenility with annual flowering to characterize the apple FLC homologs MdFLC. The phylogenetic tree analysis, which included other MADS-box genes, showed that both MdFLC1 and MdFLC3 belong to the same FLC group. MdFLC1c from one of the MdFLC1 splice variants and MdFLC3 contain the four conserved motives of an MIKC-type MADS protein. The mRNA of variants MdFLC1a and MdFLC1b contain intron sequences, and their deduced amino acid sequences lack K- and C-domains. The expression levels of MdFLC1a, MdFLC1b, and MdFLC1c decreased during the flowering induction period in a seasonal expression pattern in the adult trees, whereas the expression level of MdFLC3 did not decrease during that period. This suggests that MdFLC1 is involved in flowering induction in the annual growth cycle of adult trees. In apple seedlings, because phase change can be observed in individuals, seedlings can be used for analysis of expression during phase transition. The expression levels of MdFLC1b, MdFLC1c, and MdFLC3 were high during the juvenile phase and low during the transitional and adult phases. Because the expression pattern of MdFLC3 suggests that it plays a specific role in juvenility, MdFLC3 was subjected to functional analysis by transformation of Arabidopsis. The results revealed the function of MdFLC3 as a floral repressor. In addition, MdFT had CArG box-like sequences, putative targets for the suppression of flowering by MdFLC binding, in the introns and promoter regions. These results indicate that apple homologs of FLC, which might play a role upstream of the flowering signals, could be involved in juvenility as well as in annual flowering. Apples with sufficient genome-related information are useful as a model for studying phenomena unique to woody plants such as juvenility and annual flowering.

AB  - Iron (Fe) excess is a major constraint on crop production in flooded acidic soils, particularly in rice cultivation. Under Fe excess, plants activate a complex mechanism and network regulating Fe exclusion by roots and isolation in various tissues. In rice, the transcription factors and cis-regulatory elements (CREs) that regulate Fe excess response mechanisms remain largely elusive. We previously reported comprehensive microarray analyses of several rice tissues in response to various levels of Fe excess stress. In this study, we further explored novel CREs and promoter structures in rice using bioinformatics approaches with this microarray data. We first performed network analyses to predict Fe excess-related CREs through the categorization of the gene expression patterns of Fe excess-responsive transcriptional regulons, and found four major expression clusters: Fe storage type, Fe chelator type, Fe uptake type, and WRKY and other co-expression type. Next, we explored CREs within these four clusters of gene expression types using a machine-learning method called microarray-associated motif analyzer (MAMA), which we previously established. Through a comprehensive bioinformatics approach, we identified a total of 560 CRE candidates extracted by MAMA analyses and 42 important conserved sequences of CREs directly related to the Fe excess response in various rice tissues. We explored several novel cis-elements as candidate Fe excess CREs including GCWGCWGC, CGACACGC, and Myb binding-like motifs. Based on the presence or absence of candidate CREs using MAMA and known PLACE CREs, we found that the Boruta-XGBoost model explained expression patterns with high accuracy of about 83%. Enriched sequences of both novel MAMA CREs and known PLACE CREs led to high accuracy expression patterns. We also found new roles of known CREs in the Fe excess response, including the DCEp2 motif, IDEF1-, Zinc Finger-, WRKY-, Myb-, AP2/ERF-, MADS- box-, bZIP and bHLH- binding sequence-containing motifs among Fe excess-responsive genes. In addition, we built a molecular model and promoter structures regulating Fe excess-responsive genes based on new finding CREs. Together, our findings about Fe excess-related CREs and conserved sequences will provide a comprehensive resource for discovery of genes and transcription factors involved in Fe excess-responsive pathways, clarification of the Fe excess response mechanism in rice, and future application of the promoter sequences to produce genotypes tolerant of Fe excess.

AB  - The initiation of the reproductive phase in winter cereals is delayed during winter until favorable growth conditions resume in the spring. This delay is modulated by low temperature through the process of vernalization. The molecular and genetic bases of the interaction between environmental factors and the floral transition in these species are still unknown. However, the recent identification of the wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) TaVRT-1 gene provides an opportunity to decipher the molecular basis of the flowering-time regulation in cereals. Here, we describe the characterization of another gene, named TaVRT-2, possibly involved in the flowering pathway in wheat. Molecular and phylogenetic analyses indicate that the gene encodes a member of the MADS-box transcription factor family that belongs to a clade responsible for flowering repression in several species. Expression profiling of TaVRT-2 in near-isogenic lines and different genotypes with natural variation in their response to vernalization and photoperiod showed a strong relationship with floral transition. Its expression is up-regulated in the winter genotypes during the vegetative phase and in photoperiod-sensitive genotypes during short days, and is repressed by vernalization to a level that allows the transition to the reproductive phase. Protein-protein interaction studies revealed that TaVRT-2 interacts with proteins encoded by two important vernalization genes (TaVRT-1/VRN-1 and VRN-2) in wheat. These results support the hypothesis that TaVRT-2 is a putative repressor of the floral transition in wheat.

AB  - Posttranslational acetylation of histones is reversibly regulated by histone deacetylases (HDACs). Despite the evident significance of HDACs in Arabidopsis development, the biological roles and underlying molecular mechanisms of many HDACs are yet to be elucidated. By a reverse-genetic approach, we isolated an hda9 mutant and performed phenotypic analyses on it. In order to address the role of HDA9 in flowering, genetic, molecular, and biochemical approaches were employed. hda9 flowered early under noninductive short-day (SD) conditions and had increased expression of the floral integrator FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and the floral activator AGAMOUS-LIKE 19 (AGL19) compared with the wild-type. The hda9 mutation increased histone acetylation and RNA polymerase II occupancy at AGL19 but not at FT during active transcription, and the HDA9 protein directly targeted AGL19. AGL19 expression was higher under SD than under inductive long-day (LD) conditions, and an AGL19 overexpression caused a strong up-regulation of FT. A genetic analysis showed that an agl19 mutation is epistatic to the hda9 mutation, masking both the early flowering and the increased FT expression of hda9. Taken together, our data indicate that HDA9 prevents precocious flowering under SD conditions by curbing the hyperactivation of AGL19, an upstream activator of FT, through resetting the local chromatin environment.

AB  - Two similar, apparently full-length potato cDNAs, POTM1-1 and POTM1-2, from an early tuber cDNA library have been identified and sequenced. These two cDNAs encode 250 identical amino acids (aa) including 56 aa of the MADS-box domain and 53 aa of the K-box domain, indicating that they may function as transcription factors. The transcripts of these cDNAs accumulate abundantly in vegetative organs, suggesting that these novel MADS genes may be involved in vegetative organ development of potato.

AB  - A potato MADS-box gene cDNA (POTM1-1) from an early tuber cDNA library has been isolated and characterized. The deduced amino acid sequence of POTM1-1 cDNA encodes 250 amino acids of a putative transcription factor containing a MADS-box domain and a K-box domain. These conserved domains share high homologies to those of flower-specific homeotic proteins, TM4 of tomato and AP1 of Arabidopsis, indicating that POTM1-1 gene is a homologue of the AP1 gene family. The levels of POTM1-1 transcripts were high in axillary buds, underground stolen tips, and newly formed tubers, but relatively low in mature tubers. During axillary bud development in a model petiole-leaf cutting system, the levels of POTM1-1 transcripts were abundant in actively growing shoots and during the early stages of microtuber development. It is possible that POTM1-1 functions as a transcription factor that regulates plant developmental processes in a number of tissue types.

AB  - The POTM1-1 gene is abundantly expressed in both vegetative and reproductive organs of potato. We performed in situ hybridization and RNA blotting analysis to investigate the patterns of POTM1-1 gene expression in the flower development and the early tuber development. In the early flowers, POTM1-1 transcripts were accumulated abundantly in the developing reproductive organs, including the placentae of carpels and the pollen sacs of stamens. In contrast, the pattern of POTM1-1 distribution during late flower development was different from that of the early flower development. The POTM1-1 transcripts were abundant in the sepals and petals of late flowers, but were minimally expressed in the stamens and carpel. In the shoot apical meristem of the vegetative organs, transcripts were distributed throughout meristem domes, young leaves, and developing vascular cambium. In the early tuberization, the transcripts were widely distributed in the swollen tips of the stolons. Taken together, the results suggest that POTM1-1 gene expression is temporally and spatially regulated in active growing tissues of both vegetative and floral organs with specific distribution patterns dependent upon the developmental stages of the tissue.

AB  - A new, stable, null mutant of OsMADS1 generated by homologous recombination-based gene targeting in an indica rice confirms its regulatory role for floral meristem identity, its determinate development and floral organ differentiation. OsMADS1, an E-class MADS-box gene, is an important regulator of rice flower development. Studies of several partial loss-of-function and knockdown mutants show varied floret organ defects and degrees of meristem indeterminacy. The developmental consequences of a true null mutant on floret meristem identity, its determinate development and differentiation of grass-specific organs such as the lemma and palea remain unclear. In this study, we generated an OsMADS1 null mutant by homologous recombination-mediated gene targeting by inserting a selectable marker gene (hpt) in OsMADS1 and replacing parts of its cis-regulatory and coding sequences. A binary vector was constructed with diphtheria toxin A chain gene (DT-A) as a negative marker to eliminate random integrations and the hpt marker for positive selection of homologous recombination. Precise disruption of the endogenous OsMADS1 locus in the rice genome was confirmed by Southern hybridization. The homozygous osmads1ko null mutant displayed severe defects in all floral organs including the lemma and palea. We also noticed striking instances of floral reversion to inflorescence and vegetative states which has not been reported for other mutant alleles of OsMADS1 and further reinforces the role of OsMADS1 in controlling floral meristem determinacy. Our data suggest, OsMADS1 commits and maintains determinate floret development by regulating floral meristem termination, carpel and ovule differentiation genes (OsMADS58, OsMADS13) while its modulation of genes such as OsMADS15, OsIG1 and OsMADS32 could be relevant in the differentiation and development of palea. Further, our study provides an important perspective on developmental stage-dependent modulation of some OsMADS1 target genes.

AB  - Regulation of plant hormonal status is one of the major targets of symbiotic signaling during nodule formation in legume plants. However, the genetic and hormonal networks that regulate transition to differentiation of nodules are not well-characterized in legume plants. Analysis of plant mutants forming nodules impaired in rhizobial infection allowed us to identify some regulators involved in the control of the later stages of nodule development. In the current work, we extend our earlier studies on the influence of exogenously applied cytokinin on the later stages of nodule morphogenesis using pea sym33 (ipd3/cyclops) mutants impaired in the gene encoding IPD3/CYCLOPS transcription factor. One of the noticeable effects of the influence of exogenously applied cytokinin on nodules in the sym33-3 mutant was an increasing size of these structures. Cytokinin treatment was shown to stimulate bacterial release and increase the percentage of infected cells in nodules. To explore the role of possible regulators of nodule differentiation, we performed searching in pea transcriptome. The transcriptome study in pea P. sativum revealed the importance of the CCS52 regulator, EFD transcription factor, SYMREM regulator, RSD, the MADS-domain/AGL, and SHORT INTERNODE/STYLISH gene families encoding transcription factors in the control of nodule differentiation. Analysis of the expression patterns was verified by real-time PCR in response to exogenously applied cytokinin treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: MADS-box genes constitute a large family of transcription factors functioning as key regulators of many processes during plant vegetative and reproductive development. Type II MADS-box genes have been intensively investigated and are mostly involved in vegetative and flowering development. A growing number of studies of Type I MADS-box genes in Arabidopsis, have assigned crucial roles for these genes in gamete and seed development and have demonstrated that a number of Type I MADS-box genes are epigenetically regulated by DNA methylation and histone modifications. However, reports on agronomically important cereals such as barley and wheat are scarce. RESULTS: Here we report the identification and characterization of two Type I-like MADS-box genes, from barley (Hordeum vulgare), a monocot cereal crop of high agronomic importance. Protein sequence and phylogenetic analysis showed that the putative proteins are related to Type I MADS-box proteins, and classified them in a distinct cereal clade. Significant differences in gene expression among seed developmental stages and between barley cultivars with varying seed size were revealed for both genes. One of these genes was shown to be induced by the seed development- and stress-related hormones ABA and JA whereas in situ hybridizations localized the other gene to specific endosperm sub-compartments. The genomic organization of the latter has high conservation with the cereal Type I-like MADS-box homologues and the chromosomal position of both genes is close to markers associated with seed quality traits. DNA methylation differences are present in the upstream and downstream regulatory regions of the barley Type I-like MADS-box genes in two different developmental stages and in response to ABA treatment which may be associated with gene expression differences. CONCLUSIONS: Two barley MADS-box genes were studied that are related to Type I MADS-box genes. Differential expression in different seed developmental stages as well as in barley cultivars with different seed size was evidenced for both genes. The two barley Type I MADS-box genes were found to be induced by ABA and JA. DNA methylation differences in different seed developmental stages and after exogenous application of ABA is suggestive of epigenetic regulation of gene expression. The study of barley Type I-like MADS-box genes extends our investigations of gene regulation during endosperm and seed development in a monocot crop like barley.

AB  - We studied the DNA-binding profile of the MADS-domain transcription factor SEPALLATA3 and mutant variants by SELEX-seq. DNA-binding characteristics of SEPALLATA3 mutant proteins lead us to propose a novel DNA-binding mode. MIKC-type MADS-domain proteins, which function as essential transcription factors in plant development, bind as dimers to a 10-base-pair AT-rich motif termed CArG-box. However, this consensus motif cannot fully explain how the abundant family members in flowering plants can bind different target genes in specific ways. The aim of this study was to better understand the DNA-binding specificity of MADS-domain transcription factors. Also, we wanted to understand the role of a highly conserved arginine residue for binding specificity of the MADS-domain transcription factor family. Here, we studied the DNA-binding profile of the floral homeotic MADS-domain protein SEPALLATA3 by performing SELEX followed by high-throughput sequencing (SELEX-seq). We found a diverse set of bound sequences and could estimate the in vitro binding affinities of SEPALLATA3 to a huge number of different sequences. We found evidence for the preference of AT-rich motifs as flanking sequences. Whereas different CArG-boxes can act as SEPALLATA3 binding sites, our findings suggest that the preferred flanking motifs are almost always the same and thus mostly independent of the identity of the central CArG-box motif. Analysis of SEPALLATA3 proteins with a single amino acid substitution at position 3 of the DNA-binding MADS-domain further revealed that the conserved arginine residue, which has been shown to be involved in a shape readout mechanism, is especially important for the recognition of nucleotides at positions 3 and 8 of the CArG-box motif. This leads us to propose a novel DNA-binding mode for SEPALLATA3, which is different from that of other MADS-domain proteins known.

AB  - The molecular mechanisms by which floral homeotic genes act as major developmental switches to specify the identity of floral organs are still largely unknown. Floral homeotic genes encode transcription factors of the MADS-box family, which are supposed to assemble in a combinatorial fashion into organ-specific multimeric protein complexes. Major mediators of protein interactions are MADS-domain proteins of the SEPALLATA subfamily, which play a crucial role in the development of all types of floral organs. In order to characterize the roles of the SEPALLATA3 transcription factor complexes at the molecular level, we analyzed genome-wide the direct targets of SEPALLATA3. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by ultrahigh-throughput sequencing or hybridization to whole-genome tiling arrays to obtain genome-wide DNA-binding patterns of SEPALLATA3. The results demonstrate that SEPALLATA3 binds to thousands of sites in the genome. Most potential target sites that were strongly bound in wild-type inflorescences are also bound in the floral homeotic agamous mutant, which displays only the perianth organs, sepals, and petals. Characterization of the target genes shows that SEPALLATA3 integrates and modulates different growth-related and hormonal pathways in a combinatorial fashion with other MADS-box proteins and possibly with non-MADS transcription factors. In particular, the results suggest multiple links between SEPALLATA3 and auxin signaling pathways. Our gene expression analyses link the genomic binding site data with the phenotype of plants expressing a dominant repressor version of SEPALLATA3, suggesting that it modulates auxin response to facilitate floral organ outgrowth and morphogenesis. Furthermore, the binding of the SEPALLATA3 protein to cis-regulatory elements of other MADS-box genes and expression analyses reveal that this protein is a key component in the regulatory transcriptional network underlying the formation of floral organs.

AB  - Panicle architecture is an important component of agronomic trait in rice, which is also a key ingredient that could influence yield and quality of rice. In the panicle growth and development process, there are a series of complicated molecular and cellular events which are regulated by many interlinking genes. In this study, to explore the potential mechanism and identify genes and pathways involved in the formation of rice panicle, we compared the transcriptional profile of rice panicles (NIL-GW8 and NIL-gw8(Amol)) at three different stages of panicle development: In5 (formation of higher-order branches), In6 (differentiation of glumes) and In7 (differentiation of floral organs). A range of 40.5 to 54.1 million clean reads was aligned to 31,209 genes in our RNA-Seq analysis. In addition, we investigated transcriptomic changes between the two rice lines during different stages. A total of 726, 1121 and 2584 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified at stages 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Based on an impact analysis of the DEGs, we hypothesize that MADS-box gene family, cytochrome P450 (CYP) and pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein and various transcription factors may be involved in regulation of panicle development. Further, we also explored the functional properties of DEGs by gene ontology analysis, and the results showed that different numbers of DEGs genes were associated with 53 GO groups. In KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, many DEGs related to biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and plant hormone signal transduction, suggesting their important roles during panicle development. This study provides the first examination of changes in gene expression between different panicle development stages in rice. Our results of transcriptomic characterization provide important information to elucidate the complex molecular and cellular events about the panicle formation in rice or other cereal crops. Also, the findings will be helpful for the further identification of the genes related to panicle development.

AB  - OsMADS29 (M29) is a seed-specific MADS-box transcription factor involved in programmed cell death of nucellar tissue and maintaining auxin:cytokinin homeostasis. It affects embryo and endosperm development and starch filling during seed development in rice. Its expression seems to be tightly regulated by developmental, spatial, and temporal cues; however, cis- and trans-regulatory factors that affect its expression are largely unknown. In silico analysis of the 1.7 kb upstream regulatory region (URR) consisting of 1,290 bp promoter and 425 bp 5'-UTR regions revealed several auxin-responsive and seed-specific cis-regulatory elements distributed across the URR. In this study, the analysis of four URR deletions fused to a downstream beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter in transgenic rice has revealed the presence of several proximal positive elements and a strong distal negative element (NE). The promoter regions containing auxin-responsive elements responded positively to the exogenous application of auxins to transgenic seedlings. The proximal positive elements are capable of driving reporter expression in both vegetative and reproductive tissues. In contrast, the NE strongly suppresses reporter gene expression in both vegetative and reproductive tissues. In a transient onion peel assay system, the NE could reduce the efficacy of a 2x CaMV 35S promoter by approximately 90%. Our results indicate the existence of a complex array of positive and negative regulatory regions along with auxin-responsive elements guiding the development-dependent and spatial expression of M29.

AB  - The process of inflorescence development is directly related to yield components that determine the final grain yield in most cereal crops. Here, microarray analysis was conducted for four different developmental stages of inflorescence to identify genes expressed specifically during inflorescence development. To select inflorescence-specific expressed genes, we conducted meta-analysis using 1245 Affymetrix GeneChip array sets obtained from various development stages, organs, and tissues of members of Poaceae. The early stage of inflorescence development was accompanied by a significant upregulation of a large number of cell differentiation genes, such as those associated with the cell cycle, cell division, DNA repair, and DNA synthesis. Moreover, key regulatory genes, including the MADS-box gene, KNOTTED-1-like homeobox genes, GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR 1 gene, and the histone methyltransferase gene, were highly expressed in the early inflorescence development stage. In contrast, fewer genes were expressed in the later stage of inflorescence development, and played roles in hormone biosynthesis and meiosis-associated genes. Our work provides novel information regarding the gene regulatory network of cell division, key genes involved in the differentiation of inflorescence in wheat, and regulation mechanism of inflorescence development that are crucial stages for determining final grain number per spike and the yield potential of wheat.

AB  - The MADS (MCM1-AGAMOUS-DEFFICIENS-SRF) gene family has a preserved domain called MADS-box that regulates downstream gene expression as a transcriptional factor. Reports have revealed three MADS genes in rice, OsMADS62, OsMADS63, and OsMADS68, which exhibits preferential expression in mature rice pollen grains. To better understand the transcriptional regulation of pollen germination and tube growth in rice, we generated the loss-of-function homozygous mutant of these three OsMADS genes using the CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-CRISPR associated protein 9) system in wild-type backgrounds. Results showed that the triple knockout (KO) mutant showed a complete sterile phenotype without pollen germination. Next, to determine downstream candidate genes that are transcriptionally regulated by the three OsMADS genes during pollen development, we proceeded with RNA-seq analysis by sampling the mature anther of the mutant and wild-type. Two hundred and seventy-four upregulated and 658 downregulated genes with preferential expressions in the anthers were selected. Furthermore, downregulated genes possessed cell wall modification, clathrin coat assembly, and cellular cell wall organization features. We also selected downregulated genes predicted to be directly regulated by three OsMADS genes through the analyses for promoter sequences. Thus, this study provides a molecular background for understanding pollen germination and tube growth mediated by OsMADS62, OsMADS63, and OsMADS68 with mature pollen preferred expression.

AB  - The ABC model of floral organ identity is based on studies of Arabidopsis and Antirrhinum, both of which are highly derived eudicots. Most of the genes required for the ABC functions in Arabidopsis and Antirrhinum are members of the MADS-box gene family, and their orthologs are present in all major angiosperm lineages. Although the eudicots comprise 75% of all angiosperms, most of the diversity in arrangement and number of floral parts is actually found among basal angiosperm lineages, for which little is known about the genes that control floral development. To investigate the conservation and divergence of expression patterns of floral MADS-box genes in basal angiosperms relative to eudicot model systems, we isolated several floral MADS-box genes and examined their expression patterns in representative species, including Amborella (Amborellaceae), Nuphar (Nymphaeaceae) and Illicium (Austrobaileyales), the successive sister groups to all other extant angiosperms, plus Magnolia and Asimina, members of the large magnoliid clade. Our results from multiple methods (relative-quantitative RT-PCR, real-time PCR and RNA in situ hybridization) revealed that expression patterns of floral MADS-box genes in basal angiosperms are broader than those of their counterparts in eudicots and monocots. In particular, (i) AP1 homologs are generally expressed in all floral organs and leaves, (ii) AP3/PI homologs are generally expressed in all floral organs and (iii) AG homologs are expressed in stamens and carpels of most basal angiosperms, in agreement with the expectations of the ABC model; however, an AG homolog is also expressed in the tepals of Illicium. The broader range of strong expression of AP3/PI homologs is inferred to be the ancestral pattern for all angiosperms and is also consistent with the gradual morphological intergradations often observed between adjacent floral organs in basal angiosperms.

AB  - Development of the tuberous root of sweetpotato coincides with abnormal vascular cambium activity. The genes and pathways predominately active for vascular morphogenesis in sweetpotato root are unknown. In this study, using a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) approach, we found three sweetpotato MADS box genes expressed in root tissues. IbAGL17 is an AGL17 clade MADS box gene, and was mainly expressed in tuberous root as demonstrated by RT-PCR analysis. IbAGL20 is a TM3-1ike gene that is expressed at similar levels in leaf, vegetative shoot, flower and root tissues. IbMADS79 closely resembled the Arabidopsis AP1 and Antirrhinum SQUA genes, but IbMADS79 was expressed only in roots, whereas the mRNA levels of genes of SQUA clade were high in the flower and floral meristem. RT.PCR results confirmed that MADS box genes were also expressed in different developmental stages. These differentially expressed MADS box genes will be potential candidates for research to elucidate the molecular process related to root development in sweetpotato.

AB  - A novel hybrid weakness gene, DTE9, associated with a dark tip embryo (DTE) trait, was observed in CR6078, an introgression line derived from a cross between the Oryza sativa spp. japonica "Hwayeong" (HY) and the wild relative Oryza rufipogon. CR6078 seeds exhibit protruding embryos and flowers have altered inner floral organs. DTE9 was also associated with several hybrid weakness symptoms including decreased grain weight. Map-based cloning and transgenic approaches revealed that DTE9 is an allele of OsMADS8, a MADS-domain transcription factor. Genetic analysis indicated that two recessive complementary genes were responsible for the expression of the DTE trait. No sequence differences were observed between the two parental lines in the OsMADS8 coding region; however, numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms were detected in the promoter and intronic regions. We generated overexpression (OX) and RNA interference (RNAi) transgenic lines of OsMADS8 in HY and CR6078, respectively. The OsMADS8-OX lines showed the dark tip embryo phenotype, whereas OsMADS8-RNAi recovered the normal embryo phenotype. Changes in gene expression, including of ABCDE floral homeotic genes, were observed in the OsMADS8-OX and OsMADS8-RNAi lines. Overexpression of OsMADS8 led to decreased expression of OsEMF2b and ABA signaling-related genes including OsVP1/ABI3. HY seeds showed higher ABA content than CR6078 seeds, consistent with OsMADS8/DTE9 regulating the expression of genes related ABA catabolism in CR6078. Our results suggest that OsMADS8 is critical for floral organ determination and seed germination and that these effects are the result of regulation of the expression of OsEMF2b and its role in ABA signaling and catabolism.

AB  - New MADS-domain genes, IbMADS3 and IbMADS4, were isolated from pigmented and tuber-forming root tissue in sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas L.). Both genes were expressed preferentially in vegetative tissues, especially root tissues; white fibrous roots, pigmented roots, and developing tuberous roots. On sequence alignment, these genes fell into the STMADS group composed of SVP, STMADS11, STMADS16 and AGL24, which share high sequence similarity, similar expression patterns and similar function. Transcripts of these two genes in roots were found in the vascular cambium region. This particular expression pattern of these genes may lead to a higher proliferative potential of vegetative tissues, and may facilitate tuber initiation in sweet potato. These genes may lead to important information on the morphogenesis of vegetative structures.

AB  - Flowering time is tightly controlled by several regulatory pathways including photoperiod, vernalization in which epigenetic processes are involved. In this work, we have found that the Arabidopsis histone deacetylase gene HDA9 is involved in flowering time control. Mutation of the gene led to an early flowering phenotype in short day grown plants while without effect in long days. Analysis of flowering time regulatory gene expression revealed that hda9 mutations highly induced the expression of AGL19, but had no effect on CO, SOC1 or FLC. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that the mutations led to a clear increase of histone H3K9 and H3K27 acetylation on the AGL19 gene in short days. AGL19 promotes flowering in a way independent of the CO and FLC pathways and has been shown to be repressed by polycomb group repressive complex2 (PRC2) EMF2 but activated by vernalization. The induced levels of AGL19 expression and histone acetylation by the hda9 mutations were comparable to that of the gene under long day conditions, indicating that AGL19 is regulated also by day length and that HDA9 is involved in short day repression of AGL19 by promoting histone H3 deacetylation, which may be related to the PRC2 EMF2 complex.

AB  - Floral transition, the onset of plant reproduction, involves changes in shape and identity of the shoot apical meristem (SAM). The change in shape, termed doming, occurs early during floral transition when it is induced by environmental cues such as changes in day-length, but how it is regulated at the cellular level is unknown. We defined the morphological and cellular features of the SAM during floral transition of Arabidopsis thaliana. Both cell number and size increased during doming, and these changes were partially controlled by the gene regulatory network (GRN) that triggers flowering. Furthermore, dynamic modulation of expression of gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis and catabolism enzymes at the SAM contributed to doming. Expression of these enzymes was regulated by two MADS-domain transcription factors implicated in flowering. We provide a temporal and spatial framework for integrating the flowering GRN with cellular changes at the SAM and highlight the role of local regulation of GA.

AB  - Arabidopsis seed development involves maternal small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that induce RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) through the NRPD1-mediated pathway. To investigate their biological functions, we characterized siRNAs in the endosperm and seed coat that were separated by laser-capture microdissection (LCM) in reciprocal genetic crosses with an nrpd1 mutant. We also monitored the spatial-temporal activity of the NRPD1-mediated pathway on seed development using the AGO4:GFP::AGO4 (promoter:GFP::protein) reporter and promoter:GUS sensors of siRNA-mediated silencing. From these approaches, we identified four distinct groups of siRNA loci dependent on or independent of the maternal NRPD1 allele in the endosperm or seed coat. A group of maternally expressed NRPD1-siRNA loci targets endosperm-preferred genes, including those encoding AGAMOUS-LIKE (AGL) transcription factors. Using translational promoter:AGL::GUS constructs as sensors, we demonstrate that spatial and temporal expression patterns of these genes in the endosperm are regulated by the NRPD1-mediated pathway irrespective of complete silencing (AGL91) or incomplete silencing (AGL40) of these target genes. Moreover, altered expression of these siRNA-targeted genes affects seed size. We propose that the corresponding maternal siRNAs could account for parent-of-origin effects on the endosperm in interploidy and hybrid crosses. These analyses reconcile previous studies on siRNAs and imprinted gene expression during seed development.

AB  - To understand protein function deeply, it is important to identify how it interacts physically with its target. Phyllogen is a phyllody-inducing effector that interacts with the K domain of plant MADS-box transcription factors (MTFs), which is followed by proteasome-mediated degradation of the MTF. Although several amino acid residues of phyllogen have been identified as being responsible for the interaction, the exact interface of the interaction has not been elucidated. In this study, we comprehensively explored interface residues based on random mutagenesis using error-prone PCR. Two novel residues, at which mutations enhanced the affinity of phyllogen to MTF, were identified. These residues, and all other known interaction-involved residues, are clustered together at the surface of the protein structure of phyllogen, indicating that they constitute the interface of the interaction. Moreover, in silico structural prediction of the protein complex using ColabFold suggested that phyllogen interacts with the K domain of MTF via the putative interface. Our study facilitates an understanding of the interaction mechanisms between phyllogen and MTF.

AB  - Plant pathogenic bacteria have developed effectors to manipulate host cell functions to facilitate infection. A certain number of effectors use the conserved ubiquitin-proteasome system in eukaryotic to proteolyze targets. The proteasome utilization mechanism is mainly mediated by ubiquitin interaction with target proteins destined for degradation. Phyllogens are a family of protein effectors produced by pathogenic phytoplasmas that transform flowers into leaves in diverse plants. Here, we present a noncanonical mechanism for phyllogen action that involves the proteasome and is ubiquitin-independent. Phyllogens induce proteasomal degradation of floral MADS-box transcription factors (MTFs) in the presence of RADIATION-SENSITIVE23 (RAD23) shuttle proteins, which recruit ubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome. Intracellular localization analysis revealed that phyllogen induced colocalization of MTF with RAD23. The MTF/phyllogen/RAD23 ternary protein complex was detected not only in planta but also in vitro in the absence of ubiquitin, showing that phyllogen directly mediates interaction between MTF and RAD23. A Lys-less nonubiquitinated phyllogen mutant induced degradation of MTF or a Lys-less mutant of MTF. Furthermore, the method of sequential formation of the MTF/phyllogen/RAD23 protein complex was elucidated, first by MTF/phyllogen interaction and then RAD23 recruitment. Phyllogen recognized both the evolutionarily conserved tetramerization region of MTF and the ubiquitin-associated domain of RAD23. Our findings indicate that phyllogen functionally mimics ubiquitin as a mediator between MTF and RAD23.

AB  - In rice panicle development, new meristems are generated sequentially in an organized manner and acquire their identity in a time- and position-dependent manner. In the panicle of the panicle phytomer2-1 (pap2-1) mutant, the pattern of meristem initiation is disorganized and newly formed meristems show reduced competency to become spikelet meristems, resulting in the transformation of early arising spikelets into rachis branches. In addition, rudimentary glumes and sterile lemmas, the outermost organs of the spikelet, elongate into a leafy morphology. We propose that PAP2 is a positive regulator of spikelet meristem identity. Map-based cloning revealed that PAP2 encodes OsMADS34, a member of the SEPALLATA (SEP) subfamily of MADS-box proteins. PAP2/OsMADS34 belongs to the LOFSEP subgroup of MADS-box genes that show grass-specific diversification caused by gene duplication events. All five SEP subfamily genes in rice are expressed exclusively during panicle development, while their spatial and temporal expression patterns vary. PAP2 expression starts the earliest among the five SEP genes, and a low but significant level of PAP2 mRNA was detected in the inflorescence meristem, in branch meristems immediately after the transition, and in glume primordia, consistent with its role in the early development of spikelet formation. Our study provides new evidence supporting the hypothesis that the genes of the LOFSEP subgroup control developmental processes that are unique to grass species.

AB  - In plants, the transition to reproductive growth is of particular importance for successful seed production. Transformation of the shoot apical meristem (SAM) to the inflorescence meristem (IM) is the crucial first step in this transition. Using laser microdissection and microarrays, we found that expression of PANICLE PHYTOMER2 (PAP2) and three APETALA1 (AP1)/FRUITFULL (FUL)-like genes (MADS14, MADS15, and MADS18) is induced in the SAM during meristem phase transition in rice (Oryza sativa). PAP2 is a MADS box gene belonging to a grass-specific subclade of the SEPALLATA subfamily. Suppression of these three AP1/FUL-like genes by RNA interference caused a slight delay in reproductive transition. Further depletion of PAP2 function from these triple knockdown plants inhibited the transition of the meristem to the IM. In the quadruple knockdown lines, the meristem continued to generate leaves, rather than becoming an IM. Consequently, multiple shoots were formed instead of an inflorescence. PAP2 physically interacts with MAD14 and MADS15 in vivo. Furthermore, the precocious flowering phenotype caused by the overexpression of Hd3a, a rice florigen gene, was weakened in pap2-1 mutants. Based on these results, we propose that PAP2 and the three AP1/FUL-like genes coordinately act in the meristem to specify the identity of the IM downstream of the florigen signal.

AB  - The Polycomb-group (PcG) proteins MEDEA, FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT ENDOSPERM, and FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT SEED2 regulate seed development in Arabidopsis by controlling embryo and endosperm proliferation. All three of these FIS-class proteins are likely subunits of a multiprotein PcG complex, which epigenetically regulates downstream target genes that were previously unknown. Here we show that the MADS-box gene PHERES1 (PHE1) is commonly deregulated in the fis-class mutants. PHE1 belongs to the evolutionarily ancient type I class of MADS-box proteins that have not yet been assigned any function in plants. Both MEDEA and FIE directly associate with the promoter region of PHE1, suggesting that PHE1 expression is epigenetically regulated by PcG proteins. PHE1 is expressed transiently after fertilization in both the embryo and the endosperm; however, it remains up-regulated in the fis mutants, consistent with the proposed function of the FIS genes as transcriptional repressors. Reduced expression levels of PHE1 in medea mutant seeds can suppress medea seed abortion, indicating a key role of PHE1 repression in seed development. PHE1 expression in a hypomethylated medea mutant background resembles the wild-type expression pattern and is associated with rescue of the medea seed-abortion phenotype. In summary, our results demonstrate that seed abortion in the medea mutant is largely mediated by deregulated expression of the type I MADS-box gene PHE1.

AB  - Plant cells can communicate through the direct transport of transcription factors [1-7]. One of the best-studied examples of this phenomenon is SHORT-ROOT (SHR), which moves from the stele cells into the endodermis and root tip of Arabidopsis, where it specifies endodermal cell identity and stem cell function, respectively [8-10]. In the endodermis, SHR upregulates the transcription factors SCARECROW (SCR) [2] and JACKDAW (JKD), which in turn inhibit movement of SHR from the endodermis [11]. Although much is known about the regulatory pathways that mediate expression and activity of SHR [1, 8-14], little is known about the factors that promote its movement or the movement of other transcription factors. We have identified a novel protein, SHORT-ROOT INTERACTING EMBRYONIC LETHAL (SIEL), that interacts with SHR, CAPRICE (CPC), TARGET OF MONOPTEROUS 7 (TMO7), and AGAMOUS-LIKE 21 (AGL21). Null alleles of SIEL are embryonic lethal. Hypomorphic alleles produce defects in root patterning and reduce SHR movement. Surprisingly, both SHR and SCR regulate expression of SIEL, so that siel/scr and siel/shr double mutants have extremely disorganized roots. SIEL localizes to the nucleus and cytoplasm of root cells where it is associated with endosomes. We propose that SIEL is an endosome-associated protein that promotes intercellular movement.

AB  - FRIGIDA (FRI), as the major regulator of flowering time in Arabidopsis accessions, can activate its target FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) to delay flowering before vernalization. In addition to FLC, other FRI targets also exist in Arabidopsis. Although leaves sense environmental cues to modulate flowering time, it is not known if roots also regulate the floral transition. In this study, we investigated the spatio-temporal effect of FRI on flowering time. Local expression of FRI in the phloem and leaves activated FLC to delay flowering. Furthermore, we found that local expression of FRI in the roots also delayed flowering by activating other targets, MADS AFFECTING FLOWERING4 (MAF4) and MAF5, in the roots. Graft and genetic experiments revealed that the spatial expression of FRI in the root might generate a mobile signal, which is transmitted from roots to shoot and antagonizes the FT signal to delay flowering. Specifically expressing FRI in the embryo efficiently delayed flowering, even expressing FRI as early as the pro-embryo stage is enough to up-regulate FLC expression to delay flowering. Together, our findings demonstrate the spatio-temporal effect of FRI on delaying flowering, and we propose that root tissue also perceives the flowering signal to fine-tune the flowering time through MAF4/5 as novel targets of FRI.

AB  - The AGAMOUS-LIKE6 (AGL6)-like genes are ancient MADS-box genes and are functionally studied in a few model plants. The knowledge of these genes in wheat remains limited. Here, by studying a 'double homoeolog mutant' of the AGL6 gene in tetraploid wheat, we showed that AGL6 was required for the development of all four whorls of floral organs with dosage-dependent effect on floret fertility. Yeast two-hybrid analyses detected interactions of AGL6 with all classes of MADS-box proteins in the ABCDE model for floral organ development. AGL6 was found to interact with several additional proteins, including the G protein beta and gamma (DEP1) subunits. Analysis of the DEP1-B mutant showed a significant reduction in spikelet number per spike in tetraploid wheat, while overexpression of AGL6 in common wheat increased the spikelet number per spike and hence the grain number per spike. RNA-seq analysis identified the regulation of several meristem activity genes by AGL6, such as FUL2 and TaMADS55. Our work therefore extensively updated the wheat ABCDE model and proposed an alternative approach to improve wheat grain yield by manipulating the AGL6 gene.

AB  - MADS-domain transcription factors play pivotal roles in various developmental processes. The lack of simple loss-of-function phenotypes provides impediments to understand the biological function of some of the MADS-box transcription factors. Here we have characterized the potential role of the Arabidopsis thaliana AGAMOUS-LIKE6 (AGL6) gene by fusing full-length coding sequence with transcriptional activator and repressor domains and suggest a role for AGL6 in lateral organ development and flowering. Upon photoperiodic induction of flowering, AGL6 becomes expressed in abaxial and proximal regions of cauline leaf primordia, as well as the cryptic bracts subtending flowers. In developing flowers, AGL6 is detected in the proximal regions of all floral organs and in developing ovules. Converting AGL6 into a strong activator through fusion to the VP16 domain triggers bract outgrowth, implicating AGL6 in the development of bractless flowers in Arabidopsis. In addition, ectopic reproductive structures form on both bracts and flowers in gAGL6::VP16 transgenic plants, which is dependent on B and C class homeotic genes, but independent of LEAFY. Overexpression of both AGL6 and its transcriptional repressor form, AGL6::EAR, causes precocious flowering and terminal flower formation, suggesting that AGL6 suppresses the function of a floral repressor.

AB  - MIKC classic (MIKC(C))-type MADS-box genes encode transcription factors that function in various developmental processes, including angiosperm floral organ identity. Phylogenetic analyses of the MIKC(C)-type MADS-box family, including genes from non-flowering plants, suggest that the increased numbers of these genes in flowering plants is related to their functional divergence; however, their precise functions in non-flowering plants and their evolution throughout land plant diversification are unknown. Here, we show that MIKC(C)-type MADS-box genes in the moss Physcomitrella patens function in two ways to enable fertilization. Analyses of protein localization, deletion mutants and overexpression lines of all six genes indicate that three MIKC(C)-type MADS-box genes redundantly regulate cell division and growth in the stems for appropriate external water conduction, as well as the formation of sperm with motile flagella. The former function appears to be maintained in the flowering plant lineage, while the latter was lost in accordance with the loss of sperm.

AB  - Seed development in flowering plants is initiated after a double fertilization event with two sperm cells fertilizing two female gametes, the egg cell and the central cell, leading to the formation of embryo and endosperm, respectively. In most species the endosperm is a polyploid tissue inheriting two maternal genomes and one paternal genome. As a consequence of this particular genomic configuration the endosperm is a dosage sensitive tissue, and changes in the ratio of maternal to paternal contributions strongly impact on endosperm development. The fertilization independent seed (FIS) Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) is essential for endosperm development; however, the underlying forces that led to the evolution of the FIS-PRC2 remained unknown. Here, we show that the functional requirement of the FIS-PRC2 can be bypassed by increasing the ratio of maternal to paternal genomes in the endosperm, suggesting that the main functional requirement of the FIS-PRC2 is to balance parental genome contributions and to reduce genetic conflict. We furthermore reveal that the AGAMOUS LIKE (AGL) gene AGL62 acts as a dosage-sensitive seed size regulator and that reduced expression of AGL62 might be responsible for reduced size of seeds with increased maternal genome dosage.

AB  - Members of the AGAMOUS (AG) subfamily of MIKC-type MADS-box genes appear to control the development of reproductive organs in both gymnosperms and angiosperms. To understand the evolution of this subfamily in the flowering plants, we have identified 26 new AG-like genes from 15 diverse angiosperm species. Phylogenetic analyses of these genes within a large data set of AG-like sequences show that ancient gene duplications were critical in shaping the evolution of the subfamily. Before the radiation of extant angiosperms, one event produced the ovule-specific D lineage and the well-characterized C lineage, whose members typically promote stamen and carpel identity as well as floral meristem determinacy. Subsequent duplications in the C lineage resulted in independent instances of paralog subfunctionalization and maintained functional redundancy. Most notably, the functional homologs AG from Arabidopsis and PLENA (PLE) from Antirrhinum are shown to be representatives of separate paralogous lineages rather than simple genetic orthologs. The multiple subfunctionalization events that have occurred in this subfamily highlight the potential for gene duplication to lead to dissociation among genetic modules, thereby allowing an increase in morphological diversity.

AB  - MADS-box genes have a wide range of functions in plant reproductive development and grain production. The ABCDE model of floral organ development shows that MADS-box genes are central players in these events in dicotyledonous plants but the applicability of this model remains largely unknown in many grass crops. Here, we show that transcript analysis of all MIKCc MADS-box genes through barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) inflorescence development reveals co-expression groups that can be linked to developmental events. Thirty-four MIKCc MADS-box genes were identified in the barley genome and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) scanning of 22,626 barley varieties revealed that the natural variation in the coding regions of these genes is low and the sequences have been extremely conserved during barley domestication. More detailed transcript analysis showed that MADS-box genes are generally expressed at key inflorescence developmental phases and across various floral organs in barley, as predicted by the ABCDE model. However, expression patterns of some MADS genes, for example HvMADS58 (AGAMOUS subfamily) and HvMADS34 (SEPALLATA subfamily), clearly deviate from predicted patterns. This places them outside the scope of the classical ABCDE model of floral development and demonstrates that the central tenet of antagonism between A- and C-class gene expression in the ABC model of other plants does not occur in barley. Co-expression across three correlation sets showed that specifically grouped members of the barley MIKCc MADS-box genes are likely to be involved in developmental events driving inflorescence meristem initiation, floral meristem identity and floral organ determination. Based on these observations, we propose a potential floral ABCDE working model in barley, where the classic model is generally upheld, but that also provides new insights into the role of MIKCc MADS-box genes in the developing barley inflorescence.

AB  - The MADS-box transcription factors play essential roles in various processes of plant growth and development. In the present study, phylogenetic analysis of 142 apple MADS-box proteins with that of other dicotyledonous species identified six putative Dormancy-Associated MADS-box (DAM) and four putative Flowering Locus C-like (FLC-like) proteins. In order to study the expression of apple MADS-box genes, RNA-seq analysis of 3 apical and 5 spur bud stages during dormancy, 6 flower stages and 7 fruit development stages was performed. The dramatic reduction in expression of two MdDAMs, MdMADS063 and MdMADS125 and two MdFLC-like genes, MdMADS135 and MdMADS136 during dormancy release suggests their role as flowering-repressors in apple. Apple orthologs of Arabidopsis genes, FLOWERING LOCUS T, FRIGIDA, SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 and LEAFY exhibit similar expression patterns as reported in Arabidopsis, suggesting functional conservation in floral signal integration and meristem determination pathways. Gene ontology enrichment analysis of predicted targets of DAM revealed their involvement in regulation of reproductive processes and meristematic activities, indicating functional conservation of SVP orthologs (DAM) in apple. This study provides valuable insights into the functions of MADS-box proteins during apple phenology, which may help in devising strategies to improve important traits in apple.

AB  - MADS box genes are class of transcription factors involved in various physiological and developmental processes in plants. To understand their role in floral transition-related pathways, a genome-wide identification was done in Cajanus cajan, identifying 102 members which were classified into two different groups based on their gene structure. The status of all these genes was further analyzed in three wild species i.e. C. scarabaeoides, C. platycarpus and C. cajanifolius which revealed absence of 31-34 MADS box genes in them hinting towards their role in domestication and evolution. We could locate only a single copy of both FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) and SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) genes, while three paralogs of SUPPRESSOR OF ACTIVATION OF CONSTANS 1 (SOC1) were found in C. cajan genome. One of those SOC1 paralogs i.e. CcMADS1.5 was found to be missing in all three wild relatives, also forming separate clade in phylogeny. This SOC1 gene was also lacking the characteristic MADS box domain in it. Expression profiling of major MADS box genes involved in flowering was done in different tissues viz shoot apical meristem, vegetative leaf, reproductive meristem, and reproductive bud. Gene-based time tree of FLC and SOC1 gene dictates their divergence from Arabidopsis before 71 and 23 million year ago (mya), respectively. This study provides valuable insights into the functional characteristics, expression pattern, and evolution of MADS box proteins in grain legumes with emphasis on C. cajan, which may help in further characterizing these genes.

AB  - The rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis Muell. Arg.) is a rubber producing crop and contains specialized laticifers. MADS-box genes are a family of transcription factor genes that regulate plant development, especially floral organ and gametophyte development. 97 MADS-box genes were identified in the rubber tree through transcriptomes and genome mining. 93.8% of the genes were mapped onto the genome scaffolds in correspondence to the coverage (93.8%) of current version of sequenced genome. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that type II MADS-box genes have been more actively duplicated than their orthologous genes in Arabidopsis and rice, so that most (70, 72.2%) of the MADS-box genes in the rubber tree belong to type II subfamily. This is a high percentage compared to those in Arabidopsis (43.7%) and rice (56.8%). Moreover, 69 out of 70 type II genes in the rubber tree are transcribed, and they are mostly predominantly expressed in flowers, but some genes are predominantly expressed in laticifers, suggesting their roles in both flower and laticifer development. The number of type I genes in the rubber tree is only 27 (27.8%), a much smaller number compared to their orthologous genes in Arabidopsis (56.3%) and rice (43.2%). At the same time, most of the type I genes (55.6%, 15) in the rubber tree are silent and are probably pseudogenes. The high birth rate and low death rate of type II genes and low birth rate and high death rate of type I genes may corresponds to special developmental requirements in the rubber tree, e.g. the development of laticifer system for biosynthesis of cis-polyisoprene, the rubber. Moreover, atypical MIKC* factors (e.g. HbMADS1 in S-clade, and HbMADS20 in P-clade) are identified. These genes are diverged to typical MIKC* genes in sequences and facilitate functions required in laticifer development and rubber biosynthesis, which is not necessary in Arabidopsis and rice.

AB  - Land plants have a remarkable life cycle that alternates between a diploid sporophytic and a haploid gametophytic generation, both of which are multicellular and changed drastically during evolution. Classical MIKC MADS-domain (MIKCC) transcription factors are famous for their role in sporophytic development and are considered crucial for its evolution. About the regulation of gametophyte development, in contrast, little is known. Recent evidence indicated that the closely related MIKC* MADS-domain proteins are important for the functioning of the Arabidopsis thaliana male gametophyte (pollen). Furthermore, also in bryophytes, several MIKC* genes are expressed in the haploid generation. Therefore, that MIKC* genes have a similar role in the evolution of the gametophytic phase as MIKCC genes have in the sporophyte is a tempting hypothesis. To get a comprehensive view of the involvement of MIKC* genes in gametophyte evolution, we isolated them from a broad variety of vascular plants, including the lycophyte Selaginella moellendorffii, the fern Ceratopteris richardii, and representatives of several flowering plant lineages. Phylogenetic analysis revealed an extraordinary conservation not found in MIKCC genes. Moreover, expression and interaction studies suggest that a conserved and characteristic network operates in the gametophytes of all tested model organisms. Additionally, we found that MIKC* genes probably evolved from an ancestral MIKCC-like gene by a duplication in the Keratin-like region. We propose that this event facilitated the independent evolution of MIKC* and MIKCC protein networks and argue that whereas MIKCC genes diversified and attained new functions, MIKC* genes retained a conserved role in the gametophyte during land plant evolution.

AB  - The MADS transcription factors (TF) are an ancient eukaryotic protein family. In plants, the family is divided into two main lineages. Here, we demonstrate that DNA binding in both lineages absolutely requires a short amino acid sequence C-terminal to the MADS domain (M domain) called the Intervening domain (I domain) that was previously defined only in type II lineage MADS. Structural elucidation of the MI domains from the floral regulator, SEPALLATA3 (SEP3), shows a conserved fold with the I domain acting to stabilise the M domain. Using the floral organ identity MADS TFs, SEP3, APETALA1 (AP1) and AGAMOUS (AG), domain swapping demonstrate that the I domain alters genome-wide DNA-binding specificity and dimerisation specificity. Introducing AG carrying the I domain of AP1 in the Arabidopsis ap1 mutant resulted in strong complementation and restoration of first and second whorl organs. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the I domain acts as an integral part of the DNA-binding domain and significantly contributes to the functional identity of the MADS TF.

AB  - The common fig bears a unique closed inflorescence structure, the syconium, composed of small individual drupelets that develop from the ovaries, which are enclosed in a succulent receptacle of vegetative origin. The fig ripening process is traditionally classified as climacteric; however, recent studies have suggested that distinct mechanisms exist in its reproductive and non-reproductive parts. We analysed ABA and ethylene production, and expression of ABA-metabolism, ethylene-biosynthesis, MADS-box, NAC, and ethylene response-factor genes in inflorescences and receptacles of on-tree fruit treated with ABA, ethephon, fluridone, and nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA). Exogenous ABA and ethephon accelerated fruit ripening and softening, whereas fluridone and NDGA had the opposite effect, delaying endogenous ABA and ethylene production compared to controls. Expression of the ABA-biosynthesis genes FcNCED2 and FcABA2, ethylene-biosynthesis genes FcACS4, FcACOL, and FcACO2, FcMADS8, 14, 15, FcNAC1, 2, 5, and FcERF9006 was up-regulated by exogenous ABA and ethephon. NDGA down-regulated FcNCED2 and FcABA2, whereas fluridone down-regulated FcABA2; both down-regulated the ethylene-related genes. These results demonstrate the key role of ABA in regulation of ripening by promoting ethylene production, as in the climacteric model plant tomato, especially in the inflorescence. However, increasing accumulation of endogenous ABA until full ripeness and significantly low expression of ethylene-biosynthesis genes in the receptacle suggests non-climacteric, ABA-dependent ripening in the vegetative-originated succulent receptacle part of the fruit.

AB  - Premature leaf senescence negatively influences the physiology and yield of cotton plants. The conserved IDLNL sequence in the C-terminal region of AGL42 MADS-box determines its repressor potential for the down regulation of senescence-related genes. To determine the delay in premature leaf senescence, Arabidopsis AGL42 gene was overexpressed in cotton plants. The absolute quantification of transgenic cotton plants revealed higher mRNA expression of AGL42 compared to that of the non-transgenic control. The spatial expression of GUS fused with AGL42 and the mRNA level was highest in the petals, abscission zone (flower and bud), 8 days post anthesis (DPA) fiber, fresh mature leaves, and senescenced leaves. The mRNA levels of different NAC senescence-promoting genes were significantly downregulated in AGL42 transgenic cotton lines than those in the non-transgenic control. The photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll content were higher in AGL42 transgenic cotton lines than those in the non-transgenic control. Fluorescence in situ hybridization of the AG3 transgenic cotton line revealed a fluorescent signal on chromosome 1 in the hemizygous form. Moreover, the average number of bolls in the transgenic cotton lines was significantly higher than that in the non-transgenic control because of the higher retention of floral buds and squares, which has the potential to improve cotton fiber yield.

AB  - Although many models have been proposed that could lead to the maintenance of gene duplicates, the ways in which interacting gene duplicates influence each other's evolution and function remain poorly understood. Here, we focus on duplication and loss of the B class MADS box transcription factor genes in the euasterids I and the ramifications of such changes on paralog evolution and their encoded functions. In core eudicots, the B class genes belong to two paralogous lineages whose products form obligate heterodimers. Based on comparative genomic and phylogenetic analyses, we show that five stepwise B class MADS box gene gain or loss events occurred during the radiation of the euasterids I within core eudicots. Gene loss in one sublineage was correlated with a deficit of other sublineage genes. We also show that the gain or loss of B class MADS box gene paralogs were associated with altered protein-protein interactions among the remaining copies. These altered protein interactions were correlated with asymmetric patterns of sequence diversification and selection, suggesting that compensatory changes were driving the evolution of such genes. Furthermore, these B class MADS box gene gain or loss events were associated with the evolutionary divergence of floral morphology in the euasterids I. Together, these observations point to a cooperative strategy by which gene networks evolve, with selection maintaining the overall logic of a network despite changes in individual components.

AB  - Changes in ambient temperature affect flowering time in plants; understanding this phenomenon will be crucial for buffering agricultural systems from the effects of climate change. Here, we show that levels of FLM-beta, an alternatively spliced form of the flowering repressor FLOWERING LOCUS M, increase at lower temperatures, repressing flowering. FLM-beta interacts with SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP); SVP is degraded at high temperatures, reducing the abundance of the SVP-FLM-beta repressor complex and, thus, allowing the plant to flower. The svp and flm mutants show temperature-insensitive flowering in different temperature ranges. Control of SVP-FLM-beta repressor complex abundance via transcriptional and splicing regulation of FLM and posttranslational regulation of SVP protein stability provides an efficient, rapid mechanism for plants to respond to ambient temperature changes.

AB  - Most SVP-group MADS-box genes control meristem identity and flowering time. In rice, their roles in regulating the former are well-conserved; however, their involvement in determining the latter is not significant. Characteristically, rice SVP-group MADS-box proteins work as negative regulators in brassinosteroid (BR) responses. To elucidate the molecular mechanism, we studied the localization patterns for these proteins and found that, unexpectedly, they were not specific in the nucleus, whether expressed alone or simultaneously. Interestingly however, OsMADS22 and OsMADS47 were translocated into the nucleus along with OsMADS50 while OsMADS55 inhibited the nuclear localization of OsMADS50. An overlapping cis-element exists between the CArG motif and ARF binding site on the promoter region of OsBLE, which is upregulated by BR treatment and in SVP RNAi plants. These observations suggest that BR-mediated signals may induce target gene expression by removing the SVP-group MADS-box proteins that preoccupy the promoters of BR downstream genes.

AB  - Plant MADS-box genes can be divided into 11 groups. Genetic analysis has revealed that most of them function in flowering-time control, reproductive organ development, and vegetative growth. Here, we elucidated the role of OsMADS26, a member of the AGL12 group. Transcript levels of OsMADS26 were increased in an age-dependent manner in the shoots and roots. Transgenic plants of both rice (Oryza sativa) and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) overexpressing this gene manifested phenotypes related to stress responses, such as chlorosis, cell death, pigment accumulation, and defective root/shoot growth. In addition, apical hook development was significantly suppressed in Arabidopsis. Plants transformed with the OsMADS26-GR (glucocorticoid receptor) fusion construct displayed those stress-related phenotypes when treated with dexamethasone. Microarray analyses using this inducible system showed that biosynthesis genes for jasmonate, ethylene, and reactive oxygen species, as well as putative downstream targets involved in the stress-related process, were up-regulated in OsMADS26-overexpressing plants. These results suggest that OsMADS26 induces multiple responses that are related to various stresses.

AB  - MADS domain factors play important roles as developmental regulators in plants. In Arabidopsis thaliana, MADS domain proteins have been shown to regulate various processes during the vegetative and reproductive phases. Relatively little is known, however, about family members expressed during the embryonic phase and their function. To determine which MADS-box genes are expressed during the embryonic phase in Arabidopsis, a family-wide survey involving gene-specific primers and RT-PCR was conducted. Transcripts corresponding to 64 (out of 109 total) family members could be detected in RNA samples isolated from embryonic culture tissue. Eight MADS-box genes that appear to be expressed at higher levels during the embryonic phase than in seedlings or in inflorescence apices were identified. The spatial pattern of expression in developing seeds was characterized for four MADS-box genes (FLOWERING LOCUS C, FLOWERING LOCUS M, AGAMOUS-LIKE 15, and AGAMOUS-LIKE 18) using reporter constructs encoding translational fusions to GUS. All four are expressed in cells throughout the endosperm and embryo. Finally, to test the hypothesis that AGAMOUS-LIKE15 (AGL15) and AGAMOUS-LIKE18 (AGL18) play essential roles during the embryonic phase, plants carrying T-DNA insertions that disrupt these genes were isolated. No embryo defects were observed in agl15 or agl18 single mutants or in agl15agl18 double mutants. These results indicate that multiple regulatory pathways that involve MADS domain factors are likely to operate in embryonic tissues, and that genetic and/or functional redundancy are likely to be as prevalent as in other phases of the life cycle.

AB  - A MADS-box gene SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS1 (SOC1) integrates multiple flowering signals to regulate floral transition in Arabidopsis. Strawberry (Fragaria spp.) is an economically important fruit crop, but its molecular control of flowering is largely unknown. In this study, a SOC1-like gene, FaSOC1, was isolated and characterized from strawberry. The open reading frame of FaSOC1 was 648bp, encoding a protein of 215 amino acids. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis showed that the FaSOC1 protein contained a highly conserved MADS domain and a SOC1 motif, and that it was a member of the SOC1-like genes of dicots. The FaSOC1 protein mainly localized in the cytoplasm of onion epidermal cells and Arabidopsis protoplasts, and showed no transcriptional activation activity in yeast cells. Under the floral induction conditions, the expression of FaSOC1 increased during the first 2weeks of short-day treatment, but declined dramatically during three to 4weeks. FaSOC1 was highly expressed in reproductive organs, including shoot apices, floral buds, flowers, stamens and sepals. Overexpression of FaSOC1 in wild-type Arabidopsis caused early flowering and upregulated the expression of flowering time genes LFY and AP1. In addition, the yeast two-hybrid and BiFC assays confirmed that FaSOC1 could interact with AGL24. In conclusion, these results suggest that FaSOC1 is a flowering promoter in strawberry.

AB  - Cotton is one of the most economically important crops in the world, and drought is a key abiotic factor that can significantly reduce cotton yield. MADS-box transcription factors play essential roles in various aspects of plant growth and development as well as responses to biotic and abiotic stress. However, the use of MADS-box transcription factors to regulate water stress responses has not been fully explored in cotton. Here, we showed that GhAGL16 acts as a negative regulator of water deficit in cotton, at least in part by regulating ABA signaling. GhAGL16-overexpressing (GhAGL16-OE) transgenic Arabidopsis had lower survival rates and relative water contents (RWCs) under water stress. Isolated leaves of GhAGL16-OE Arabidopsis had increased water loss rates, likely attributable to their increased stomatal density. GhAGL16-OE Arabidopsis also showed reduced primary root lengths in response to mannitol treatment and decreased sensitivity of seed germination to ABA treatment. By contrast, silencing GhAGL16 in cotton enhanced tolerance to water deficit by increasing proline (Pro) content, increasing superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) activities, and reducing malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) contents under water stress. Subcellular localization and transcriptional activation assays confirmed that GhAGL16 is a nuclear protein that lacks transcriptional self-activation activity. The expression of ABA biosynthesis-related genes (GhNCED3/7/14), a catabolism-related gene (GhCYP707A), and a gene related to the ABA signaling pathway (GhABF4) was altered in GhAGL16-silenced plants. Taken together, our data demonstrate that GhAGL16 plays an important role in cotton resistance to water stress.

AB  - The number of dioecious species for which the genetic basis of sex determination has been resolved is rapidly increasing. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms downstream of the sex determinants remain largely elusive. Here, by RNA-sequencing early-flowering isogenic aspen (Populus tremula) lines differing exclusively for the sex switch gene ARR17, we show that a narrowly defined genetic network controls differential development of female and male flowers. Although ARR17 encodes a type-A response regulator supposedly involved in cytokinin (CK) hormone signalling, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9-mediated arr17 knockout only affected the expression of a strikingly small number of genes, indicating a specific role in the regulation of floral development rather than a generic function in hormone signalling. Notably, the UNUSUAL FLORAL ORGANS (UFO) gene, encoding an F-box protein acting as a transcriptional cofactor with LEAFY (LFY) to activate B-class MADS-box gene expression, and the B-class gene PISTILLATA (PI), necessary for male floral organ development, were strongly de-repressed in the arr17 CRISPR mutants. Our data highlight a CK-independent role of the poplar response regulator ARR17 and further emphasize the minimal differences between female and male individuals. This article is part of the theme issue 'Sex determination and sex chromosome evolution in land plants'.

AB  - The APETALA1/SQUAMOSA (AP1/SQUA)-like genes of flowering plants play crucial roles in the development processes of floral meristems, sepals, petals and fruits. Although many of the AP1/SQUA-like genes have been characterized in angiosperms, few have been identified in basal angiosperm taxa. Therefore, the functional evolution of the AP1/SQUA subfamily is still unclear. We characterized an AP1 homolog, MawuAP1, from Magnolia wufengensis that is an ornamental woody plant belonging to the basal angiosperms. Gene sequence and phylogenetic analyses suggested that MawuAP1 was clustered with the FUL-like homologous genes of basal angiosperms and had FUL motif and paleoAP1 motif domain, but it did not have the euAP1 motif domain of core eudicots. Expression pattern analysis showed that MawuAP1 was highly expressed in vegetative and floral organs, particularly in the early stage of flower bud development and pre-anthesis. Protein-protein interaction pattern analysis revealed that MawuAP1 has interaction with an A-class gene (MawuAP1), C-class gene (MawuAG-1) and E-class gene (MawuAGL9) of the MADS-box family genes. Ectopic expression in Arabidopsis thaliana indicated that MawuAP1 could significantly promote flowering and fruit development, but it could not restore the sepal and petal formation of ap1 mutants. These results demonstrated that there are functional differences in the specification of sepal and petal floral organs and development of fruits among the AP1/SQUA-like genes, and functional conservation in the regulation of floral meristem. These findings provide strong evidence for the important functions of MawuAP1 in floral meristem determination, promoting flowering and fruit development, and further highlight the importance of AP1/SQUA subfamily in biological evolution and diversity.

AB  - MADS-box genes play well-documented roles in plant development, but relatively little is known regarding their involvement in defence responses. In this study, pre-treatment of peach (Prunus persica) fruit with beta-aminobutyric acid (BABA) activated resistance against Rhizopus stolonifer, leading to a significant delay in the symptomatic appearance of disease. This was associated with an integrated defence response that included a H2O2 burst, ABA accumulation, and callose deposition. cDNA library screening identified nucleus-localized MADS2 as an interacting partner with NPR1, and this was further confirmed by yeast two-hybrid, luciferase complementation imaging, and co-immunoprecipitation assays. The DNA-binding activity of NPR1 conferred by the NPR1-MADS2 complex was required for the transcription of SA-dependent pathogenesis-related (PR) and ABA-inducible CalS genes in order to gain the BABA-induced resistance, in which MAPK1-induced post-translational modification of MADS2 was also involved. In accordance with this, overexpression of PpMADS2 in Arabidopsis potentiated the transcription of a group of PR genes and conferred fungal resistance in the transgenic plants. Conversely, Arabidopsis mads2-knockout lines showed high sensitivity to the fungal pathogen. Our results indicate that MADS2 positively participates in BABA-elicited defence in peach through a combination of SA-dependent NPR1 activation and ABA signaling-induced callose accumulation, and that this defence is also related to the post-translational modification of MADS2 by MAPK1 for signal amplification.

AB  - The spikelet is the basic unit of the grass inflorescence. In this study, we show that wheat MADS-box genes VRN1, FUL2 and FUL3 play critical and redundant roles in spikelet and spike development, and also affect flowering time and plant height. In the vrn1ful2ful3-null triple mutant, the inflorescence meristem formed a normal double-ridge structure, but then the lateral meristems generated vegetative tillers subtended by leaves instead of spikelets. These results suggest an essential role of these three genes in the fate of the upper spikelet ridge and the suppression of the lower leaf ridge. Inflorescence meristems of vrn1ful2ful3-null and vrn1ful2-null remained indeterminate and single vrn1-null and ful2-null mutants showed delayed formation of the terminal spikelet and increased number of spikelets per spike. Moreover, the ful2-null mutant showed more florets per spikelet, which together with a higher number of spikelets, resulted in a significant increase in the number of grains per spike in the field. Our results suggest that a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying wheat spikelet and spike development can inform future strategies to improve grain yield in wheat.

AB  - Plant meristems are responsible for the generation of all plant tissues and organs. Here we show that the transcription factor (TF) FAR-RED ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL3 (FHY3) plays an important role in both floral meristem (FM) determinacy and shoot apical meristem maintenance in Arabidopsis, in addition to its well-known multifaceted roles in plant growth and development during the vegetative stage. Through genetic analyses, we show that WUSCHEL (WUS) and CLAVATA3 (CLV3), two central players in the establishment and maintenance of meristems, are epistatic to FHY3 Using genome-wide ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data, we identify hundreds of FHY3 target genes in flowers and find that FHY3 mainly acts as a transcriptional repressor in flower development, in contrast to its transcriptional activator role in seedlings. Binding motif-enrichment analyses indicate that FHY3 may coregulate flower development with three flower-specific MADS-domain TFs and four basic helix-loop-helix TFs that are involved in photomorphogenesis. We further demonstrate that CLV3, SEPALLATA1 (SEP1), and SEP2 are FHY3 target genes. In shoot apical meristem, FHY3 directly represses CLV3, which consequently regulates WUS to maintain the stem cell pool. Intriguingly, CLV3 expression did not change significantly in fhy3 and phytochrome B mutants before and after light treatment, indicating that FHY3 and phytochrome B are involved in light-regulated meristem activity. In FM, FHY3 directly represses CLV3, but activates SEP2, to ultimately promote FM determinacy. Taken together, our results reveal insights into the mechanisms of meristem maintenance and determinacy, and illustrate how the roles of a single TF may vary in different organs and developmental stages.

AB  - Winter dormancy (WD) is a crucial strategy for plants coping with potentially deadly environments. In recent decades, this process has been extensively studied in economically important perennial eudicots due to changing climate. However, in evergreen monocots with no chilling requirements, dormancy processes are so far a mystery. In this study, we compared the WD process in closely related evergreen (Iris japonica) and deciduous (I. tectorum) iris species across crucial developmental time points. Both iris species exhibit a 'temporary' WD process with distinct durations, and could easily resume growth under warm conditions. To decipher transcriptional changes, full-length sequencing for evergreen iris and short read RNA sequencing for deciduous iris were applied to generate respective reference transcriptomes. Combining results from a multipronged approach, SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE and FRUITFULL (FUL) from MADS-box was associated with a dormancy- and a growth-related module, respectively. They were co-expressed with genes involved in phytohormone signaling, carbohydrate metabolism, and environmental adaptation. Also, gene expression patterns and physiological changes in the above pathways highlighted potential abscisic acid and jasmonic acid antagonism in coordinating growth and stress responses, whereas differences in carbohydrate metabolism and reactive oxygen species scavenging might lead to species-specific WD durations. Moreover, a detailed analysis of MIKCCMADS-box in irises revealed common features described in eudicots as well as possible new roles for monocots during temporary WD, such as FLOWERING LOCUS C and FUL. In essence, our results not only provide a portrait of temporary WD in perennial monocots but also offer new insights into the regulatory mechanism underlying WD in plants.

AB  - MADS-box transcription factors play crucial and diverse roles in plant growth and development, and the responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. However, the implementation of MADS-box transcription factors in regulating plant architecture and stress responses has not been fully explored in tomato. Here, we found that a novel MADS-box transcription factor, SlMBP22, participated in the control of agronomical traits, tolerance to abiotic stress, and regulation of auxin and gibberellin signalling. Transgenic plants overexpressing SlMBP22 (SlMBP22-OE) displayed pleiotropic phenotypes, including reduced plant height and leaf size, by affecting auxin and/or gibberellin signalling. SlMBP22 was induced by dehydration treatment, and SlMBP22-OE plants were more tolerant to drought stress than wild-type (WT). Furthermore, SlMBP22 overexpression plants accumulated more chlorophyll, starch and soluble sugar than WT, indicating that the darker green leaves might be attributed to increased chlorophyll levels in the transgenic plants. RNA-Seq results showed that the transcript levels of a series of genes related to chloroplast development, chlorophyll metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, hormone signalling, and stress responses were altered. Collectively, our data demonstrate that SlMBP22 plays an important role in both regulating tomato growth and resisting drought stress.

AB  - Davidia involucrata Baill. (dove tree) is unique Tertiary relic plant in China, also known as 'living fossil' and 'giant panda'. The MADS-box family gene SOC1 is involved in the regulatory pathway that integrates flowering signals to promote flowering at the optimal time. In this study, we isolated and identified two dove tree SOC1 homologues, named DiSOC1-a and DiSOC1-b. These two sequences possess highly conserved domains MADS-box and SOC1-motif, as well as the semi-conserved region K-box. DiSOC1-a and DiSOC1-b were expressed at varying levels in all tested tissues of dove tree and shared high levels of expression in the flower buds. The expression tendencies of both genes in bract were initially upward and then downward and were highest in young bracts. Neither DiSOC1-a nor DiSOC1-b was expressed in immature leaves. Proteins encoded by DiSOC1-a and DiSOC1-b were located in the nucleus. In addition, ectopic overexpression of both genes in WT Arabidopsis promoted early flowering and the growth of the main bolt. Taken together, these results suggest that DiSOC1-a and DiSOC1-b are involved in the flowering initiation and the main bolt growth process of dove tree. Our results provide a foundation for horticultural breeding to control flowering time of dove tree.

AB  - Temperature stresses affect plant phenotypic diversity. The developmental stability of the inflorescence, required for reproductive success, is tightly regulated by the interplay of genetic and environmental factors. However, the mechanisms underpinning how plant inflorescence architecture responds to temperature are largely unknown. We demonstrate that the barley SEPALLATA MADS-box protein HvMADS1 is responsible for maintaining an unbranched spike architecture at high temperatures, while the loss-of-function mutant forms a branched inflorescence-like structure. HvMADS1 exhibits increased binding to target promoters via A-tract CArG-box motifs, which change conformation with temperature. Target genes for high-temperature-dependent HvMADS1 activation are predominantly associated with inflorescence differentiation and phytohormone signalling. HvMADS1 directly regulates the cytokinin-degrading enzyme HvCKX3 to integrate temperature response and cytokinin homeostasis, which is required to repress meristem cell cycle/division. Our findings reveal a mechanism by which genetic factors direct plant thermomorphogenesis, extending the recognized role of plant MADS-box proteins in floral development.

AB  - ABSTRACT MADS-box genes play a central role in the development of flowers in plants. In this study, 11 PpMADSs were isolated from ‘Luxing’ peach, and the expression levels were detected in different tissues and fruit development. Eleven PpMADSs, designated as PpMADS13, 14, 18, 23, 24, 25, 32, 33, 34, 35, and 39 were isolated. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that PpMADS13, 14, and 18 belonged to SVP, AGL15, and MIKC* group respectively; PpMADS23, 24, 25, and 39 were in the Mα group; PpMADS32, 33, 34, and 35 belonged to the Mγ group. Predictions from subcellular localization showed that 10 PpMADS were located in the nucleus. RT-PCR revealed that PpMADS13 was expressed in stems, leaves, and during fruit development (70d); PpMADS14 was expressed in sepals, stamens, petals, and during flower development; PpMADS18 was expressed in roots, stems, leaves, sepals, ovaries, stamens, petals, and during flower and fruit development; all MADS-box genes (expect for PpMADS33) in the Mα and Mγ group were expressed in roots, stems, leaves, sepals, ovaries, stamens, petals, and during flower development; few genes were expressed during fruit development. These results indicated that PpMADS may play a crucial regulatory role in vegetative growth and development processes of flowers and fruits in peaches.

AB  - In plants MADS-box transcription factors (TFs) play important roles in growth and development. However, no plant MADS-box gene has been identified to have a function related to secondary metabolites regulation. Here, a MADS-box TF gene, designated as HbMADS4, was isolated from Hevea brasiliensis by the yeast one-hybrid experiment to screen the latex cDNA library using the promoter of the gene encoding H. brasiliensis small rubber particle protein (HbSRPP) as bait. HbMADS4 was 984-bp containing 633-bp open reading frame encoding a deduced protein of 230 amino acid residues with a typical conserved MADS-box motif at the N terminus. HbMADS4 was preferentially expressed in the latex, but little expression was detected in the leaves, flowers, and roots. Its expression was inducible by methyl jasmonate and ethylene. Furthermore, transient over-expression and over-expression of HbMADS4 in transgenic tobacco plants significantly suppressed the activity of the HbSRP promoter. Altogether, it is proposed that HbMADS4 is a negative regulator of HbSRPP which participates in the biosynthesis of natural rubber.

AB  - Alternative splicing (AS) plays a crucial role in plant growth, development and response to various environmental changes. However, whether alternative splicing of MADS-box transcription factors contributes to the flower bud dormancy process in fruit trees still remains unknown. In this work, the AS profile of genes in the dormant flower buds of 'Dangshansu' pear tree were examined. A total number of 3661 alternatively spliced genes were identified, and three mRNA isoforms of the dormancy associated MADS box (DAM) gene, PpDAM1, derived by alternative splicing, designated as PpDAM1.1, PpDAM1.2 and PpDAM1.3, were characterized. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) analysis indicated that AS of PpDAM1 didn't affect the nucleus localization and homo-/heterodimerization of PpDAM1.1, PpDAM1.2 and PpDAM1.3 proteins, but disturbed the translocation of PpDAM1.1/PpDAM1.1, PpDAM1.3/PpDAM1.3, PpDAM1.1/PpDAM1.3, and PpDAM1.2/PpDAM1.3 dimers to the nucleus. Constitutive expression of PpDAM1.2, but not PpDAM1.1 and PpDAM1.3, in Arabidopsis retarded the growth and development of transgenic plants. Further comparative expression analyses of PpDAM1.1, PpDAM1.2 and PpDAM1.3 in the flower buds of 'Dangshansu' and a less dormant pear cultivar, 'Cuiguan', exhibited that the expression of all the three isoforms in 'Dangshansu' were significantly higher than in 'Cuiguan', especially PpDAM1.2, which showed a predominantly higher expression than PpDAM1.1 and PpDAM1.3 in both cultivars. Our results suggest that alternative splicing of PpDAM1 could play a crucial role in pear flower bud dormancy process.

AB  - Inflorescence architecture is an important determinant of crop productivity. The number of spikelets produced by the wheat inflorescence meristem (IM) before its transition to a terminal spikelet (TS) influences the maximum number of grains per spike. Wheat MADS-box genes VERNALIZATION 1 (VRN1) and FRUITFULL 2 (FUL2) (in the SQUAMOSA-clade) are essential to promote the transition from IM to TS and for spikelet development. Here we show that SQUAMOSA genes contribute to spikelet identity by repressing MADS-box genes VEGETATIVE TO REPRODUCTIVE TRANSITION 2 (VRT2), SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE 1 (SVP1), and SVP3 in the SVP clade. Constitutive expression of VRT2 resulted in leafy glumes and lemmas, reversion of spikelets to spikes, and downregulation of MADS-box genes involved in floret development, whereas the vrt2 mutant reduced vegetative characteristics in spikelets of squamosa mutants. Interestingly, the vrt2 svp1 mutant showed similar phenotypes to squamosa mutants regarding heading time, plant height, and spikelets per spike, but it exhibited unusual axillary inflorescences in the elongating stem. We propose that SQUAMOSA-SVP interactions are important to promote heading, formation of the TS, and stem elongation during the early reproductive phase, and that downregulation of SVP genes is then necessary for normal spikelet and floral development. Manipulating SVP and SQUAMOSA genes can contribute to engineering spike architectures with improved productivity.

AB  - Floral organ identity genes, most of which are MADS‐box genes, play key roles in flower development and floral organ identity determination. To specify the identities of different floral organ types, proteins of the floral MADS‐box genes need to form dimers and higher‐level complexes before they bind to the control regions of downstream genes and regulate their expression. Previous studies have shown that understanding the evolution of the interactions among proteins of the floral MADS‐box genes may be an excellent step towards uncovering the underlying mechanisms of the origin of the flower. Yet, due to the lack of such information in early‐branching angiosperm lineages, it has been difficult to determine the evolutionary changes of the protein–protein interactions (PPIs) before and after the origin of the flower. In this study, we first isolated counterparts of the floral MADS‐box genes from Nuphar pumila (Timm) D.C., a representative of the basalmost angiosperms Nymphaeales, and investigated the interactions among their proteins by carrying out yeast two‐hybrid assays. We then estimated the PPIs in the most recent common ancestor of extant angiosperms by using two different methods: ancestral character state reconstruction and ancestral sequence reconstruction followed by yeast two‐hybrid assay. Based on these results, we examined the evolutionary transitions of the PPIs before and after the occurrence of extant angiosperms, and discussed their contributions to the origin of the flower. We found that duplication and diversification of floral MADS‐box genes, as well as non‐random losses of some once‐existed PPIs, have been the driving force of the origin of the flower.

AB  - Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is important for large-scale hybrid seed production. Rearrangements in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) for the cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) CMS line J4A were responsible for pollen abortion. However, the expression patterns of nuclear genes associated with pollen abortion and the molecular basis of CMS for J4A are unknown, and were the objectives of this study by comparing J4A with the J4B maintainer line. Cytological evaluation of J4A anthers showed that microspore abortion occurs during meiosis preventing pollen development. Changes in enzyme activity of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV and mitochondrial respiratory chain complex V and the content of ribosomal protein and ATP during anther abortion were observed for J4A suggesting insufficient synthesis of ATP hindered pollen production. Additionally, levels of sucrose, starch, soluble sugar, and fructose were significantly altered in J4A during the meiosis stage, suggesting reduced sugar metabolism contributed to sterility. Transcriptome and miRNAomics analyses identified 4461 differentially expressed mRNAs (DEGs) and 26 differentially expressed microRNAs (DEMIs). Pathway enrichment analysis indicated that the DEMIs were associated with starch and sugar metabolism. Six deduced target gene regulatory pairs that may participate in CMS were identified, ghi-MIR7484-10/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 6 (MAPKK6), ghi-undef-156/agamous-like MADS-box protein AGL19 (AGL19), ghi-MIR171-1-22/SNF1-related protein kinase regulatory subunit gamma-1 and protein trichome birefringence-like 38, and ghi-MIR156-(8/36)/WRKY transcription factor 28 (WRKY28). Overall, a putative CMS mechanism involving mitochondrial dysfunction, the ghi-MIR7484-10/MAPKK6 network, and reduced glucose metabolism was suggested, and ghi-MIR7484-10/MAPKK6 may be related to abnormal microspore meiosis and induction of excessive sucrose accumulation in anthers.

AB  - Photoperiod is a major determinant of chasmogamous (CH)-cleistogamous (CL) dimorphic flower development in Viola philippica, and only long-day (LD) conditions induce CL flowers. In this study, it was found that the active gibberellin (GA) content in CL floral buds was higher than in CH floral buds formed under short-day (SD) conditions, suggesting that the biosynthesis of active GAs is enhanced by a longer photoperiod and may be associated with dimorphic flower development. Thus, the next step was to molecularly characterize the key V. philippica GA synthesis genes GA 20-oxidase (VpGA20ox) and GA 3-oxidase (VpGA3ox). In terms of the expression of VpGA20ox and VpGA3ox, it was found that the active GAs could be upregulated in developing pistils under both LD and SD conditions to develop functional pistils, and GAs could also accumulate in the stamens under SD conditions. The anthers and the adjacent petals were well developed under SD conditions. In contrast, the above-mentioned floral organs displayed low GA contents under LD conditions and were poorly developed. Although the application of paclobutrazol, an inhibitor of GA synthesis, did not reverse CL development under LD conditions, exogenous GAs could partially trigger the transition from CH to CL flowers under relative SD conditions (</=12 h daylight). This was coupled with the downregulation of B-class MADS-box genes, thereby restraining stamen and petal development. Both VpGA20ox and VpGA3ox exhibited similar expression profiles with B-class MADS-box genes in the development of the stamens and petals. Therefore, in response to photoperiod, GA signaling could affect the expression of B-class homeotic genes and regulate dimorphic flower development in Viola. As a compensation for poorly-developed nectaries, anthers, and petals, filament elongation, style shortness, and inward bending could ensure self-pollination in CL flowers. This work provides new insights into the regulation of CH-CL floral development and the evolutionary significance of the formation of dimorphic flowers.

AB  - Fruit ripening is regulated by epigenetic modifications and transcription factors, which may function independently or as protein complexes. Our previous study showed that the apple histone deacetylase19 (MdHDA19) suppresses fruit ripening through the deacetylation of histones in related genes. Here, a MADS-box transcription factor (MdMADS6) was identified using a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay as a candidate protein that interacts with MdHDA19 during apple fruit ripening. Furthermore, Y2H, bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) and pull-down assays were used to confirm the interaction between MdHDA19 and MdMADS6. Agrobacterium-mediated transient transformation and yeast one-hybrid assays showed that MdMADS6 promoted carotenoid accumulation in apple fruit by acting on the downstream target genes related to carotenoid biosynthesis. In summary, we conclude that, in the early stages of fruit development, the expression of MdMADS6 was maintained at lower levels, where it interacted with MdHDA19 to form a protein complex that inhibited the expression of the downstream genes. At the late stages of fruit development, active expression of MdMADS6 dissociated the protein complex of MdMADS6 and MdHDA19 and consequently promoted the expression of carotenoid biosynthesis genes as well as carotenoid accumulation.

AB  - Fruit development and ripening is regulated by genetic and environmental factors and is of critical importance for seed dispersal, reproduction, and fruit quality. Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) ripening inhibitor (rin) mutant fruit have a classic ripening-inhibited phenotype, which is attributed to a genomic DNA deletion resulting in the fusion of two truncated transcription factors, RIN and MC In wild-type fruit, RIN, a MADS-box transcription factor, is a key regulator of the ripening gene expression network, with hundreds of gene targets controlling changes in color, flavor, texture, and taste during tomato fruit ripening; MC, on the other hand, has low expression in fruit, and the potential functions of the RIN-MC fusion gene in ripening remain unclear. Here, overexpression of RIN-MC in transgenic wild-type cv Ailsa Craig tomato fruits impaired several ripening processes, and down-regulating RIN-MC expression in the rin mutant was found to stimulate the normal yellow mutant fruit to produce a weak red color, suggesting a distinct negative role for RIN-MC in tomato fruit ripening. By comparative transcriptome analysis of rin and rin 35S::RIN-MC RNA interference fruits, a total of 1,168 and 1,234 genes were identified as potential targets of RIN-MC activation and inhibition. Furthermore, the RIN-MC fusion gene was shown to be translated into a chimeric transcription factor that was localized to the nucleus and was capable of protein interactions with other MADS-box factors. These results indicated that tomato RIN-MC fusion plays a negative role in ripening and encodes a chimeric transcription factor that modulates the expression of many ripening genes, thereby contributing to the rin mutant phenotype.

AB  - Alpinia genus are known generally as ginger-lilies for showy flowers in the ginger family, Zingiberaceae, and their floral morphology diverges from typical monocotyledon flowers. However, little is known about the functions of ginger MADS-box genes in floral identity. In this study, four AP1/AGL9 MADS-box genes were cloned from Alpinia hainanensis, and protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and roles of the four genes in floral homeotic conversion and in floral evolution are surveyed for the first time. AhFUL is clustered to the AP1 lineage, AhSEP4 and AhSEP3b to the SEP lineage, and AhAGL6-like to the AGL6 lineage. The four genes showed conserved and divergent expression patterns, and their encoded proteins were localized in the nucleus. Seven combinations of PPI (AhFUL-AhSEP4, AhFUL-AhAGL6-like, AhFUL-AhSEP3b, AhSEP4-AhAGL6-like, AhSEP4-AhSEP3b, AhAGL6-like-AhSEP3b, and AhSEP3b-AhSEP3b) were detected, and the PPI patterns in the AP1/AGL9 lineage revealed that five of the 10 possible combinations are conserved and three are variable, while conclusions cannot yet be made regarding the other two. Ectopic expression of AhFUL in Arabidopsis thaliana led to early flowering and floral organ homeotic conversion to sepal-like or leaf-like. Therefore, we conclude that the four A. hainanensis AP1/AGL9 genes show functional conservation and divergence in the floral identity from other MADS-box genes.

AB  - Flowers are imperative reproductive organs and play a key role in the propagation of offspring, along with the generation of several metabolic products in flowering plants. In Juglans mandshurica, the number and development of flowers directly affect the fruit yield and subsequently its commercial value. However, owing to the lack of genetic information, there are few studies on the reproductive biology of Juglans mandshurica, and the molecular regulatory mechanisms underlying the development of female and male inflorescence remain unclear. In this study, phytohormones and transcriptomic sequencing analyses at the three stages of female and male inflorescence growth were performed to understand the regulatory functions underlying flower development. Gibberellin is the most dominant phytohormone that regulates flower development. In total, 14,579 and 7188 differentially expressed genes were identified after analyzing the development of male and female flowers, respectively, wherein, 3241 were commonly expressed. Enrichment analysis for significantly enriched pathways suggested the roles of MAPK signaling, phytohormone signal transduction, and sugar metabolism. Genes involved in floral organ transition and flowering were obtained and analyzed; these mainly belonged to the M-type MADS-box gene family. Three flowering-related genes (SOC1/AGL20, ANT, and SVP) strongly interacted with transcription factors in the co-expression network. Two key CO genes (CO3 and CO1) were identified in the photoperiod pathway. We also identified two GA20xs genes, one SVP gene, and five AGL genes (AGL8, AGL9, AGL15, AGL19, and AGL42) that contributed to flower development. The findings are expected to provide a genetic basis for the studies on the regulatory networks and reproductive biology in inflorescence development for J. mandshurica.

AB  - Autophagy is a highly conserved, self-digestion process that is essential for plant adaptations to various environmental stresses. Although the core components of autophagy in plants have been well established, the molecular basis for its transcriptional regulation remains to be fully characterized. In this study, we demonstrate that SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS1 (SOC1), a MADS-box family transcription factor that determines flowering transition in Arabidopsis, functions as a transcriptional repressor of autophagy. EMSAs, ChIP-qPCR assays, and dual-luciferase receptor assays showed that SOC1 can bind to the promoters of ATG4b, ATG7, and ATG18c via the conserved CArG box. qRT-PCR analysis showed that the three ATG genes ATG4b, ATG7, and ATG18c were up-regulated in the soc1-2 mutant. In line with this, the mutant also displayed enhanced autophagy activity, as revealed by increased autophagosome formation and elevated autophagic flux compared with the wild type. More importantly, SOC1 negatively affected the tolerance of plants to long-term carbon starvation, and this process requires a functional autophagy pathway. Finally, we found that SOC1 was repressed upon carbon starvation at both the transcriptional and protein levels. Overall, our study not only uncovers an important transcriptional mechanism that contributes to the regulation of plant autophagy in response to nutrient starvation, but also highlights novel cellular functions of the flowering integrator SOC1.

AB  - Some of MADS-box transcription factors (TFs) have been shown to play essential roles in the adaptation of plant to abiotic stress. Still, the mechanisms that MADS-box proteins regulate plant stress response are not fully understood. Here, a stress-responsive MADS-box TF OsMADS23 from rice conferring the osmotic stress tolerance in plants is reported. Overexpression of OsMADS23 remarkably enhanced, but knockout of the gene greatly reduced the drought and salt tolerance in rice plants. Further, OsMADS23 was shown to promote the biosynthesis of endogenous ABA and proline by activating the transcription of target genes OsNCED2, OsNCED3, OsNCED4 and OsP5CR that are key components for ABA and proline biosynthesis, respectively. Then, the convincing evidence showed that the OsNCED2-knockout mutants had lower ABA levels and exhibited higher sensitivity to drought and oxidative stress than wild type, which is similar to osmads23 mutant. Interestingly, the SnRK2-type protein kinase SAPK9 was found to physically interact with and phosphorylate OsMADS23, and thus increase its stability and transcriptional activity. Furthermore, the activation of OsMADS23 by SAPK9-mediated phosphorylation is dependent on ABA in plants. Collectively, these findings establish a mechanism that OsMADS23 functions as a positive regulator in response to osmotic stress by regulating ABA biosynthesis, and provide a new strategy for improving drought and salt tolerance in rice.

AB  - Cotton fibers, as natural fibers, are widely used in the textile industry in the world. In order to find genes involved in fiber development, a cDNA (designated as GhMADS11) encoding a novel MADS protein with 151 amino acid residues was isolated from cotton fiber cDNA library. The deduced protein shares high similarity with Arabidopsis AP1 and AGL8 in MADS domain. However, the GhMADS11 protein (being absent of the partial K-domain and normal C-terminus) is shorter than AP1 and AGL8 by the reason of gene frameshift mutation during evolution. The experimental results revealed that GhMADS11 was not a transcriptional activator, and it did not form homodimer. GhMADS11 transcripts were specifically accumulated in elongating fibers, but no or very low signals of its expression were detected in other tissues of cotton. Overexpression of GhMADS11 in fission yeast promotes atypical cell elongation by 1.4-2.0-fold. Furthermore, morphological analysis indicated that the transformed cells expressing GhMADS11m, a MIKC-type derivative of GhMADS11 by the site-directed mutation, displayed the same phenotype as that of the transformed cells with GhMADS11. The concurrence of these data sets suggested that GhMADS11 protein may function in fiber cell elongation, and its MADS domain and partial K-domain are sufficient for this function.

AB  - A major obstacle for orchid (Orchidaceae) breeding and production is a long juvenile phase before orchid reproductive development. The molecular basis for prolonged vegetative growth in orchids remains largely unclear despite many efforts to clarify the relevant mechanisms. In this study, we report functional characterization of Dendrobium Orchid TERMINAL FLOWER1 (DOTFL1), an ortholog of TFL1 in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), from the orchid Dendrobium Chao Praya Smile. DOTFL1 is highly expressed in pseudobulbs and the shoot apical meristem (SAM) before and during the floral transition, but is downregulated in inflorescence apices and open flowers. Ectopic expression of DOTFL1 rescues the early-flowering and terminal-flower phenotypes of tfl1-20 in Arabidopsis. Overexpression of DOTFL1 in Dendrobium orchids delays flowering and produces defective inflorescence meristems and flowers with vegetative traits, whereas knockdown of DOTFL1 accelerates flowering and perturbs the maintenance of the inflorescence meristem. Notably, DOTFL1 suppresses orchid flowering and associated pseudobulb formation during the floral transition. We further reveal that two orchid MADS-box transcription factors, Dendrobium Orchid SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 (DOSOC1) and AGAMOUS-LIKE 24 (DOAGL24), could interact with each other and bind to the CArG-box motif at DOTFL1, implying a regulatory hierarchy similar to their counterparts in Arabidopsis. Taken together, our findings suggest that DOTFL1 promotes vegetative growth, modulates successive developmental events required for reproductive success in Dendrobium orchids, and may have evolved with a previously unknown role in controlling pseudobulb formation in the Orchidaceae family.

AB  - Malate dehydrogenase (MDH; EC 1.1.1.37) plays a vital role in plant growth and development as well as abiotic stress responses, and it is widely present in plants. However, the MDH family genes have not been explored in sweet potato. In this study, nine, ten, and ten MDH genes in sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) and its two diploid wild relatives, Ipomoea trifida and Ipomoea triloba, respectively, were identified. These MDH genes were unevenly distributed on seven different chromosomes among the three species. The gene duplications and nucleotide substitution analysis (Ka/Ks) revealed that the MDH genes went through segmental duplications during their evolution under purifying selection. A phylogenetic and conserved structure divided these MDH genes into five subgroups. An expression analysis indicated that the MDH genes were omni-presently expressed in distinct tissues and responded to various abiotic stresses. A transcription factor prediction analysis proved that Dof, MADS-box, and MYB were the main transcription factors of sweet potato MDH genes. These findings provide molecular features of the MDH family in sweet potato and its two diploid wild relatives, which further supports functional characterizations.

AB  - Epimedium L. (Berberidaceae, Ranales), a perennial traditional Chinese medicinal herb, has become a new popular landscape plant for ground cover and pot culture in many countries based on its excellent ornamental characteristics and, distinctive and diverse floral morphology. However, little is known about the molecular genetics of flower development in Epimedium sagittatum. Here, we describe the characterization of EsSVP that encodes a protein sharing 68, 54, and 35% similarity with SVP, AGAMOUS-like 24 (AGL24) and SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 (SOC1) in Arabidopsis, respectively. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) indicated that EsSVP transcripts were principally found in petiole and leaf tissues, with little expression in roots and flowers and no in fruits. The highest EsSVP expression was observed in leaves. The flowering time of 35S::EsSVP in most Arabidopsis thaliana and in all petunia plants was not affected in both photoperiod conditions, but 35S::EsSVP 5# and 35S::EsSVP 1# Arabidopsis lines induced late and early flowering under long day (LD, 14 h light/10 h dark) and short day (SD, 10 h light/14 h dark) conditions, respectively. The 35S::EsSVP Arabidopsis produced extra secondary inflorescence or floral meristems in the axils of the leaf-like sepals with excrescent trichomes, and leaf-like sepals not able to enclose the inner three whorls completely. Moreover, almost all transgenic Arabidopsis plants showed persistent sepals around the completely matured fruits. Upon ectopic expression of 35S::EsSVP in Petunia W115, sepals were enlarged, sometimes to the size of leaves; corollas were greenish and did not fully open. These results suggest that EsSVP is involved in inflorescence meristem identity and flowering time regulation in some conditions. Although, the SVP homologs might have suffered functional diversification among diverse species between core and basal eudicots, the protein functions are conserved between Arabidopsis/Petunia and Epimedium.

AB  - MADS-box transcription factors are widely involved in the regulation of plant growth, developmental processes, and response to abiotic stresses. Perilla frutescens, a versatile plant, is not only used for food and medicine but also serves as an economical oil crop. However, the MADS-box transcription factor family in P. frutescens is still largely unexplored. In this study, a total of 93 PfMADS genes were identified in P. frutescens genome. These genes, including 37 Type I and 56 Type II members, were randomly distributed across 20 chromosomes and 2 scaffold regions. Type II PfMADS proteins were found to contain a greater number of motifs, indicating more complex structures and diverse functions. Expression analysis revealed that most PfMADS genes (more than 76 members) exhibited widely expression model in almost all tissues. The further analysis indicated that there was strong correlation between some MIKC(C)-type PfMADS genes and key genes involved in lipid synthesis and flavonoid metabolism, which implied that these PfMADS genes might play important regulatory role in the above two pathways. It was further verified that PfMADS47 can effectively mediate the regulation of lipid synthesis in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii transformants. Using cis-acting element analysis and qRT-PCR technology, the potential functions of six MIKC(C)-type PfMADS genes in response to abiotic stresses, especially cold and drought, were studied. Altogether, this study is the first genome-wide analysis of PfMADS. This result further supports functional and evolutionary studies of PfMADS gene family and serves as a benchmark for related P. frutescens breeding studies.

AB  - Flowering time is a major determinant of the local adaptation of plants. Although numerous loci affecting flowering time have been mapped in maize, their underlying molecular mechanisms and roles in adaptation remain largely unknown. Here, we report the identification and characterization of MADS-box transcription factor ZmMADS69 that functions as a flowering activator through the ZmRap2.7-ZCN8 regulatory module and contributes to adaptation. We show that ZmMADS69 underlies a quantitative trait locus controlling the difference in flowering time between maize and its wild ancestor, teosinte. Maize ZmMADS69 allele is expressed at a higher level at floral transition and confers earlier flowering than the teosinte allele under long days and short days. Overexpression of ZmMADS69 causes early flowering, while a transposon insertion mutant of ZmMADS69 exhibits delayed flowering. ZmMADS69 shows pleiotropic effects for multiple traits of agronomic importance. ZmMADS69 functions upstream of the flowering repressor ZmRap2.7 to downregulate its expression, thereby relieving the repression of the florigen gene ZCN8 and causing early flowering. Population genetic analyses showed that ZmMADS69 was a target of selection and may have played an important role as maize spread from the tropics to temperate zones. Our findings provide important insights into the regulation and adaptation of flowering time.

AB  - Sex differences and evolutionary differences are critical biological issues. Ginkgo is an ancient lineage of dioecious gymnosperms with special value for studying the mechanism of sex determination in plants. However, the major genetic basic underlying sex chromosomes remains to be uncovered. In this study, we identify the sex-determining region of Ginkgo and locate it to the area from megabases 48 to 75 on chromosome 2. We find that the male sex-determining region of Ginkgo contains more than 200 genes, including four MADS-box genes, demonstrating that the Ginkgo sex determination system is of the XY type. We also find that genetic sex differences result in specialized flavonoid metabolism and regulation in each sex. These findings establish a foundation for revealing the molecular mechanism of sexual dimorphism and promoting the development of the Ginkgo industry.

AB  - Ovule formation is essential for realizing crop yield because it determines seed number. The underlying molecular mechanism, however, remains elusive. Here, we show that cell wall invertase (CWIN) functions as a positive regulator of ovule initiation in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). In situ hybridization revealed that CWIN2 and CWIN4 were expressed at the placenta region where ovule primordia initiated. Specific silencing of CWIN2 and CWIN4 using targeted artificial microRNA driven by an ovule-specific SEEDSTICK promoter (pSTK) resulted in a substantial reduction of CWIN transcript and activity, which blocked ovule initiation and aggravated ovule abortion. There was no induction of carbon (C) starvation genes in the transgenic lines, and supplementing newly forming floral buds with extra C failed to recover the ovule phenotype. This indicates that suppression of CWIN did not lead to C starvation. A group of hexose transporters was downregulated in the transgenic plants. Among them, two representative ones were spatially coexpressed with CWIN2 and CWIN4, suggesting a coupling between CWIN and hexose transporters for ovule initiation. RNA-sequencing analysis identified differentially expressed genes encoding putative extracellular receptor-like kinases, MADS-box transcription factors, including STK, and early auxin response genes in response to CWIN-silencing. Our data demonstrate the essential role of CWIN in ovule initiation, which is most likely to occur through sugar signaling instead of C nutrient contribution. We propose that CWIN-mediated sugar signaling may be perceived by, and transmitted through, hexose transporters or receptor-like kinases to regulate ovule formation by modulating downstream auxin signaling and MADS-box transcription factors.

AB  - The fruit, which mediates the maturation and dispersal of seeds, is a complex structure unique to flowering plants. Seed dispersal in plants such as Arabidopsis occurs by a process called fruit dehiscence, or pod shatter. Few studies have focused on identifying genes that regulate this process, in spite of the agronomic value of controlling seed dispersal in crop plants such as canola. Here we show that the closely related SHATTERPROOF (SHP1) and SHATTERPROOF2 (SHP2) MADS-box genes are required for fruit dehiscence in Arabidopsis. Moreover, SHP1 and SHP2 are functionally redundant, as neither single mutant displays a novel phenotype. Our studies of shp1 shp2 fruit, and of plants constitutively expressing SHP1 and SHP2, show that these two genes control dehiscence zone differentiation and promote the lignification of adjacent cells. Our results indicate that further analysis of the molecular events underlying fruit dehiscence may allow genetic manipulation of pod shatter in crop plants.

AB  - Orchids exhibit a range of unique flower shapes and are a valuable ornamental crop. MADS-box transcription factors are key regulatory components in flower initiation and development. Changing the flower shape and flowering time can increase the value of the orchid in the ornamental horticulture industry. In this study, 28 MADS-box genes were identified from the transcriptome database of the model orchid Erycina pusilla. The full-length genomic sequences of these MADS-box genes were obtained from BAC clones. Of these, 27 were MIKC-type EpMADS (two truncated forms) and one was a type I EpMADS. Eleven EpMADS genes contained introns longer than 10 kb. Phylogenetic analysis classified the 24 MIKC(c) genes into nine subfamilies. Three specific protein motifs, AG, FUL and SVP, were identified and used to classify three subfamilies. The expression profile of each EpMADS gene correlated with its putative function. The phylogenetic analysis was highly correlated with the protein domain identification and gene expression results. Spatial expression of EpMADS6, EpMADS12 and EpMADS15 was strongly detected in the inflorescence meristem, floral bud and seed via in situ hybridization. The subcellular localization of the 28 EpMADS proteins was also investigated. Although EpMADS27 lacks a complete MADS-box domain, EpMADS27-YFP was localized in the nucleus. This characterization of the orchid MADS-box family genes provides useful information for both orchid breeding and studies of flowering and evolution.

AB  - Seed germination is a crucial transition point in plant life and is tightly regulated by environmental conditions through the coordination of two phytohormones, gibberellin and abscisic acid (ABA). To avoid unfavorable conditions, plants have evolved safeguard mechanisms for seed germination. The present contribution reports a novel function of the Arabidopsis MCM1/AGAMOUS/DEFICIENS/SRF(MADS)-box transcription factor ARABIDOPSIS NITRATE REGULATED 1 (ANR1) in seed germination. ANR1 knockout mutant is insensitive to ABA, salt and osmotic stress during the seed germination and early seedling development stages, whereas ANR1-overexpressing lines are hypersensitive. ANR1 is responsive to ABA and abiotic stresses and upregulates the expression of ABA Intolerant (ABI)3 to suppress seed germination. ANR1 and ABI3 have similar expression pattern during seed germination. Genetically, ABI3 acts downstream of ANR1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and yeast-one-hybrid assays showed that ANR1 could bind to the ABI3 promoter to regulate its expression. In addition, ANR1 acts synergistically with AGL21 to suppress seed germination in response to ABA as evidenced by anr1 agl21 double mutant. Taken together, the results herein demonstrate that the ANR1 plays an important role in regulating seed germination and early postgermination growth. ANR1 and AGL21 together constitutes a safeguard mechanism for seed germination to avoid unfavorable conditions.

AB  - Lotus (Nelumbo nucifera) is a highly recognized flower with high ornamental value. Flower color and flower morphology are two main factors for flower lotus breeding. Petaloidy is a universal phenomenon in lotus flowers. However, the genetic regulation of floral organ petaloidy in lotus remains elusive. In this study, the transcriptomic analysis was performed among three organs, including petal, carpel petaloidy, and carpel in lotus. A total of 1,568 DEGs related to carpel petaloidy were identified. Our study identified one floral homeotic gene encoded by the MADS-box transcription factor, AGAMOUS (AG) as the candidate gene for petaloid in lotus. Meanwhile, a predicted labile boundary in floral organs of N. nucifera was hypothesized. In summary, our results explored the candidate genes related to carpel petaloidy, setting a theoretical basis for the molecular regulation of petaloid phenotype.

AB  - Cymbidium sinense is one of the most important traditional Chinese Orchids due to its unique and highly ornamental floral organs. Although the ABCDE model for flower development is well-established in model plant species, the precise roles of these genes in C. sinense are not yet fully understood. In this study, four SEPALLATA-like genes were isolated and identified from C. sinense. CsSEP1 and CsSEP3 were grouped into the AGL9 clade, while CsSEP2 and CsSEP4 were included in the AGL2/3/4 clade. The expression pattern of CsSEP genes showed that they were significantly accumulated in reproductive tissues and expressed during flower bud development but only mildly detected or even undetected in vegetative organs. Subcellular localization revealed that CsSEP1 and CsSEP4 were localized to the nucleus, while CsSEP2 and CsSEP3 were located at the nuclear membrane. Promoter sequence analysis predicted that CsSEP genes contained a number of hormone response elements (HREs) and MADS-box binding sites. The early flowering phenotype observed in transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing four CsSEP genes, along with the expression profiles of endogenous genes, such as SOC1, LFY, AG, FT, SEP3 and TCPs, in both transgenic Arabidopsis and C. sinense protoplasts, suggested that the CsSEP genes played a regulatory role in the flowering transition by influencing downstream genes related to flowering. However, only transgenic plants overexpressing CsSEP3 and CsSEP4 caused abnormal phenotypes of floral organs, while CsSEP1 and CsSEP2 had no effect on floral organs. Protein-protein interaction assays indicated that CsSEPs formed a protein complex with B-class CsAP3-2 and CsSOC1 proteins, affecting downstream genes to regulate floral organs and flowering time. Our findings highlighted both the functional conservation and divergence of SEPALLATA-like genes in C. sinense floral development. These results provided a valuable foundation for future studies of the molecular network underlying floral development in C. sinense.

AB  - Maternally inherited defects in the formation of male flower organs leading to cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) indicate an involvement of mitochondrial genes in the control of flower formation. In the 'carpeloid' CMS type of carrot, stamens are replaced by carpels. The florets thus resemble well-investigated homeotic flower mutants of Arabidopsis and Antirrhinum, in which organ identity is impaired because of the mutation of specific nuclear MADS box genes. We have isolated five cDNAs encoding MADS box proteins (DcMADS1-5) from a flower-specific library of carrot. Structural features deduced from their sequence and transcript patterns in unmodified carrot flowers determined by in situ hybridisation relate them to known MADS box transcription factors involved in specification of flower organs. In 'carpeloid' CMS flowers, we detected a distinctly reduced expression of DcMADS2 and DcMADS3, homologues of the Antirrhinum genes GLOBOSA and DEFICIENS. Our data strongly suggest that the 'carpeloid' CMS phenotype is caused by a cytoplasmic (mitochondrial) effect on the expression of two MADS box factors specifying organ development at whorls 2 and 3 of carrot flowers.

AB  - Development of floral organs exhibits complex molecular mechanisms involving the co-regulation of many genes specialized and precisely functioning in various tissues and developing stages. Advance in spatial transcriptome technologies allows for quantitative measurement of spatially localized gene abundance making it possible to bridge complex scenario of flower organogenesis with genome-wide molecular phenotypes. Here, we apply the 10x Visium technology in the study of the formation of floral organs through development in an orchid plant, Phalaenopsis Big Chili. Cell-types of early floral development including inflorescence meristems, primordia of floral organs and identity determined tissues, are recognized based on spatial expression distribution of thousands of genes in high resolution. In addition, meristematic cells on the basal position of floral organs are found to continuously function in multiple developmental stages after organ initiation. Particularly, the development of anther, which primordium starts from a single spot to multiple differentiated cell-types in later stages including pollinium and other vegetative tissues, is revealed by well-known MADS-box genes and many other downstream regulators. The spatial transcriptome analyses provide comprehensive information of gene activity for understanding the molecular architecture of flower organogenesis and for future genomic and genetic studies of specific cell-types.

AB  - Floral patterning in Arabidopsis requires activation of floral homeotic genes by the floral meristem identity gene, LEAFY (LFY). Here we show that precise activation of expression of class B and C homeotic genes in floral meristems is regulated by three flowering time genes, SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP), SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 (SOC1), and AGAMOUS-LIKE 24 (AGL24), through direct control of a LFY coregulator, SEPALLATA3 (SEP3). Orchestrated repression of SEP3 by SVP, AGL24, and SOC1 is mediated by recruiting two interacting chromatin regulators, TERMINAL FLOWER 2/LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN 1 and SAP18, a member of SIN3 histone deacetylase complex. Our finding of coordinated regulation of SEP3 by flowering time genes reveals a hitherto unknown genetic pathway that prevents premature differentiation of floral meristems and determines the appropriate timing of floral organ patterning.

AB  - Floral MADS-box genes encode transcription factors that play critical roles in the development and evolution of the flower. Proteins of floral MADS-box genes regulate the expression of their downstream genes by forming various homodimers/heterodimers and quaternary complexes. Interactions among proteins of floral MADS-box genes have been documented in several model species, yet the information accumulated so far is still not sufficient to draw a general picture of the evolution of the interactions. We have characterized 28 putative floral MADS-box genes from three representative basal eudicots (i.e., Euptelea pleiospermum, Akebia trifoliata, and Pachysandra terminalis) and investigated the protein-protein interactions (PPIs) among the proteins encoded by these genes using yeast two-hybrid assays. We found that, although the PPIs in basal eudicots are largely consistent with those in core eudicots and monocots, there are lineage-specific features that have not been observed elsewhere. We also reconstructed the evolutionary histories of the PPIs among members of seven MADS-box gene lineages (i.e., AP1, AP3, PI, AG, STK, AGL2, and AGL9) in angiosperms. We revealed that the PPIs were extremely conserved in nine (or 32.1%) of the 28 possible combinations, whereas considerable variations existed in seven (25.0%) of them; in the remaining 12 (or 42.9%) combinations, however, no interaction was observed. Notably, most of the PPIs required for the formation of quaternary complexes, as suggested by the "quartet model," were highly conserved. This suggested that the evolutionarily conservative PPIs may have played critical roles in the establishment of the basic structure (or architecture) of the flower and experienced coevolution to maintain their functions. The evolutionarily variable PPIs, however, seem to have played subsidiary roles in flower development and have contributed to the variation in floral traits.

AB  - Organ abscission is a key step in a plant's life cycle and is one of the most important agronomic traits for crops. In tomato, two MADS-box genes, JOINTLESS (J) and MACROCAYLYX (MC), have been shown to be implicated in development of the flower abscission zone (AZ), but the molecular mechanisms underlying this process are not well known. We report here that the SEPALLATA (SEP) MADS-box gene SLMBP21 acts as an additional factor for development of the AZ in tomato. We show that knockdown of SLMBP21 abolishes development of the flower AZ, while overexpression of SLMBP21 produces small cells at the proximal section of the pedicel and the peduncle. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis confirms that SLMBP21 interacts with J and MC, and co-immunoprecipitation assays further demonstrates that these three proteins may form higher-order protein complexes. In situ hybridization shows that SLMBP21, J, and MC transcripts accumulate in distinct regions, but overlap at the AZ vasculature. In addition, transactivation assays in yeast show that, of the three interacting proteins, only SLMBP21 can activate reporter gene transcription. RNA-seq analysis furthermore reveals that loss of function of SLMBP21, J, or MC affects a common subset of meristem activity genes including LeWUS and LATERAL SUPPRESSOR that were specifically expressed in the AZ on the tomato flower pedicel. Since SLMBP21 belongs to the FBP9/23 subclade of the SEP gene family, which is absent in Arabidopsis, the SLMBP21-J-MC complex may represent a distinct mechanism for development of the AZ in plants.

AB  - Fruit development involves chloroplast development, carotenoid accumulation and fruit coloration. Although genetic regulation of fruit development has been extensively investigated, epigenetic regulation of fruit coloration remains largely unexplored. Here, we report a naturally occurring epigenetic regulation of TAGL1, and its impact on chloroplast development and fruit coloration. We used a genome-wide association study in combination with map-based cloning to identify the GREEN STRIPE (GS) locus, a methylated isoform of TAGL1 regulating diversified chloroplast development and carotenoid accumulation. Nonuniform pigmentation of fruit produced by GS was highly associated with methylation of the TAGL1 promoter, which is linked to a SNP at SL2.50ch07_63842838. High degrees of methylation of the TAGL1 promoter downregulated its expression, leading to green stripes. By contrast, low degrees of methylation led to light green stripes in gs. RNA-seq and ChIP collectively showed that the expression of genes involved with Chl synthesis and chloroplast development were significantly upregulated in green stripes relative to light green stripes. Quantitative PCR and dual luciferase assay confirmed that TAGL1 downregulates expression of SlMPEC, SlPsbQ, and SlCAB, and upregulates expression of PSY1 - genes which are associated with chloroplast development and carotenoid accumulation. Altogether, our findings regarding the GS locus demonstrate that naturally occurring methylation of TAGL1 has diverse effects on plastid development in fruit.

AB  - Iris laevigata is ideal for gardening and landscaping in northeast China because of its beautiful flowers and strong cold resistance. However, the short length of flowering time (2 days for individual flowers) greatly limits its applications. Molecular breeding and engineering hold high potential for producing I. laevigata of desirable flowering properties. A prerequisite is to identify and characterize key flowering control genes, the identity of which remains largely unknown in I. laevigata due to the lack of genome information. To fill this knowledge gap, we used sequencing data of the I. laevigata transcriptome to identify MADS-box gene-encoding transcription factors that have been shown to play key roles in developmental processes, including flowering. Our data revealed 41 putative MADS-box genes, which consisted of 8 type I (5 Malpha and 3 Mbeta, respectively) and 33 type II members (2 MIKC* and 31 MIKC(C), respectively). We then selected IlSEP3 and IlSVP for functional studies and found that both are localized to the nucleus and that they interact physically in vitro. Ectopic expression of IlSEP3 in Arabidopsis resulted in early flowering (32 days) compared to that of control plants (36 days), which could be mediated by modulating the expression of FT, SOC1, AP1, SVP, SPL3, VRN1, and GA20OX. By contrast, plants overexpressing IlSVP were phenotypically similar to that of wild type. Our functional validation of IlSEP3 was consistent with the notion that SEP3 promotes flowering in multiple plant species and indicated that IlSEP3 regulates flowering in I. laevigata. Taken together, this work provided a systematic identification of MADS-box genes in I. laevigata and demonstrated that the flowering time of I. laevigata can be genetically controlled by altering the expression of key MADS-box genes.

AB  - Chrysanthemum morifolium has ornamental and economic values. However, there has been minimal research on the morphology of the chrysanthemum florets and related genes. In this study, we used the leaves as a control to screen for differentially expressed genes between ray and disc florets in chrysanthemum flowers. A total of 8,359 genes were differentially expressed between the ray and disc florets, of which 3,005 were upregulated and 5,354 were downregulated in the disc florets. Important regulatory genes that control flower development and flowering determination were identified. Among them, we identified a TM6 gene (CmTM6-mu) that belongs to the Class B floral homeotic MADS-box transcription factor family, which was specifically expressed in disc florets. We isolated this gene and found it was highly similar to other typical TM6 lineage genes, but a single-base deletion at the 3' end of the open reading frame caused a frame shift that generated a protein in which the TM6-specific paleoAP3 motif was missing at the C terminus. The CmTM6-mu gene was ectopically expressed in Arabidopsis thaliana. Petal and stamen developmental processes were unaffected in transgenic A. thaliana lines; however, the flowering time was earlier than in the wild-type control. Thus, the C-terminal of paleoAP3 appears to be necessary for the functional performance in regulating the development of petals or stamens and CmTM6-mu may be involved in the regulation of flowering time in chrysanthemum. The results of this study will be useful for future research on flowering molecular mechanisms and for the breeding of novel flower types.

AB  - MIKC(C)-type MADS-box (MIKC(C)) genes encode transcription factors that have crucial roles in controlling floral organogenesis and flowering time in plants. Although this gene family has been well characterized in many plant species, its evolutionary and comprehensive functional analysis in rose is lacking. In this study, 58 non-redundant MIKC(C) uni-transcripts were extensively identified from rose transcriptomes. Phylogenetic analysis placed these genes into 12 clades with their Arabidopsis and strawberry counterparts, and revealed that ABCDE model (including AP1/FUL, AP3/PI, AG, and SEP clades), and SOC1 and AGL6 clade genes have remarkably expanded in Rosa chinensis, whereas genes from the FLC and AGL17 clades were undetectable. Sequence alignments suggest that the AP3/PI clade may contribute to more specific functions in rose due to a high variation of amino acid residues within its MADS-box domains. A comparative analysis of gene expression in specific floral organ differentiation stages and floral organs between R. chinensis cv. Old Blush and the closely related mutant genotype R. chinensis cv. Viridiflora (floral organs mutated into leaf-like structures) further revealed the roles of ABCDE model genes during floral organogenesis in rose. Analysis of co-expression networks provided an overview of the regulatory mechanisms of rose MIKC(C) genes and shed light on both the prominent roles of AP3/PI clade genes in floral organogenesis and the roles of RcAGL19, RcAGL24, and RcSOC1 in regulating floral transition in rose. Our analyses provide an overall insight of MIKC(C) genes in rose and their potential roles in floral organogenesis.

AB  - Bananas are model fruits for studying starch conversion and climactericity. Starch degradation and ripening are two important biological processes that occur concomitantly in banana fruit. Ethylene biosynthesis and postharvest fruit ripening processes, i.e. starch degradation, fruit softening, and sugar accumulation, are highly correlated and thus could be controlled by a common regulatory switch. However, this switch has not been identified. In this study, we transformed red banana (Musa acuminata L.) with sense and anti-sense constructs of the MaMADS36 transcription factor gene (also MuMADS1, Ma05_g18560.1). Analysis of these lines showed that MaMADS36 interacts with 74 other proteins to form a co-expression network and could act as an important switch to regulate ethylene biosynthesis, starch degradation, softening, and sugar accumulation. Among these target genes, musa acuminata beta-amylase 9b (MaBAM9b, Ma05_t07800.1), which encodes a starch degradation enzyme, was selected to further investigate the regulatory mechanism of MaMADS36. Our findings revealed that MaMADS36 directly binds to the CA/T(r)G box of the MaBAM9b promoter to increase MaBAM9b transcription and, in turn, enzyme activity and starch degradation during ripening. These results will further our understanding of the fine regulatory mechanisms of MADS-box transcription factors in regulating fruit ripening, which can be applied to breeding programs to improve fruit shelf-life.

AB  - MADS-box genes that are homologous to Arabidopsis SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) have been shown to play key roles in the regulation of bud dormancy in perennial species, particularly in the deciduous fruit trees of Rosaceae. However, their evolutionary profiles in Rosaceae have not yet been analyzed systematically. Here, The SVP genes were found to be significantly expanded in Rosaceae when compared with annual species from Brassicaceae. Phylogenetic analysis showed that Rosaceae SVP genes could be classified into five clades, namely, SVP1, SVP2-R1, SVP2-R2, SVP2-R3 and SVP3. The SVP1 clade genes were retained in most of the species, whereas the SVP2-R2 and SVP2-R3 clades were found to be Maleae- and Amygdaleae-specific (Both of the lineages belong to Amygdaloideae), respectively, and SVP2-R1 was Rosoideae-specific in Rosaceae. Furthermore, 10 lineage-specific gene duplication (GD) events (GD1-10) were proposed for the expansion of SVP genes, suggesting that the expansion and divergence of Rosaceae SVP genes were mainly derived by lineage-specific manner during evolution. Moreover, tandem and segmental duplications were the major reasons for the expansion of SVP genes, and interestingly, tandem duplications, a well-known evolutionary feature of SVP genes, were found to be mainly Amygdaloideae-specific. Sequence alignment, selection pressure, and cis-acting element analysis suggested large functional innovations and diversification of SVP genes in different lineages of Rosaceae. Finally, the different growth cycle of Rosa multiflora and their novel expression patterns of RmSVP genes provided new insights into the functional diversification of SVP genes in terms of their roles in processes other than bud dormancy.

AB  - KEY MESSAGE : The interaction of MuMADS1 and MuUBA in banana was reported, which will help us to understand the mechanism of the MADS-box gene in regulating banana fruit development and ripening. The ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 gene fragment MuUBA was obtained from banana (Musa acuminata L.AAA) fruit by the yeast two-hybrid method using the banana MADS-box gene MuMADS1 as bait and 2-day post-harvest banana fruit cDNA library as prey. MuMADS1 interacted with MuUBA. The interaction of MuMADS1 and MuUBA in vivo was further proved by bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay. Real-time quantitative PCR evaluation of MuMADS1 and MuUBA expression patterns in banana showed that they are highly expressed in the ovule 4 stage, but present in low levels in the stem, which suggests a simultaneously differential expression action exists for both MuMADS1 and MuUBA in different tissues and developmental fruits. MuMADS1 and MuUBA expression was highly stimulated by exogenous ethylene and suppressed by 1-methylcyclopropene. These results indicated that MuMADS1 and MuUBA were co-regulated by ethylene and might play an important role in post-harvest banana fruit ripening.

AB  - The MADS-box protein family includes many transcription factors that have a conserved DNA-binding MADS-box domain. The proteins in this family were originally recognized to play prominent roles in floral development. Recent findings, especially with regard to the regulatory roles of the AGL17 subfamily in root development, have greatly broadened their known functions. In this study, a gene from soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.), GmNMHC5, was cloned from the Zigongdongdou cultivar and identified as a member of the AGL17 subfamily. Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR analysis showed that GmNMHC5 was expressed at much higher levels in roots and nodules than in other organs. The activation of expression was first examined in leaves and roots, followed by shoot apexes. GmNMHC5 expression levels rose sharply when the plants were treated under short-day conditions (SD) and started to pod, whereas low levels were maintained in non-podding plants under long-day conditions (LD). Furthermore, overexpression of GmNMHC5 in transgenic soybean significantly promoted lateral root development and nodule building. Moreover, GmNMHC5 is upregulated by exogenous sucrose. These results indicate that GmNMHC5 can sense the sucrose signal and plays significant roles in lateral root development and nodule building.

AB  - SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) genes are members of the well-known MADS-box gene family that regulates vital developmental processes in plants. In Arabidopsis, there are two SVP paralogs, SVP/AGAMOUS-LIKE22 (SVP/AGL22) and AGL24. SVP protein suppresses the flowering process, whereas AGL24 acts as a flowering activator. Phylogenetic analysis of SVP genes representing most of the sequenced eudicot species showed that the SVP gene family could be divided into three major clades in eudicots (SVP1, SVP2, and SVP3), most likely resulting from an ancient whole-genome triplication in core eudicots. Among them, the SVP1 (SVP) and SVP2 (AGL24) clades are retained in nearly all species, whereas the SVP3 clade has been lost in Brassicaceae, Myrtaceae, and some species in other families. Reflecting lineage-specific tandem duplication and whole-genome duplication, SVP gene copy numbers ranged from 3 to 11 in the analyzed species. Sequence analysis showed that SVP3 proteins have obvious differences with SVP1 and SVP2 in the C-terminal (C) domain and intervening (I) domain. Positive selection analysis also showed that the omega (dN/dS) value was highest in the SVP3 clade, with 17 positive selection sites detected in the SVP3 clade. Promoter analysis for cis-regulatory elements showed that some genes in the SVP2 and SVP3 clades may be regulated by abscisic acid, ethylene, and gibberellin. RNA-seq data from grape, poplar, and apple revealed that genes in SVP3 group are highly expressed in vegetative organs such as buds, leaves, cotyledons, and dormant buds in particular, indicating the involvement of genes belong to SVP3 group in the dormancy process. Overall, the findings underscore the functional diversity of the SVP genes in eudicots.

AB  - There are two groups of MADS intervening keratin-like and C-terminal (MIKC)-type MADS box genes, MIKC(C) type and MIKC* type. In seed plants, the MIKC(C) type shows considerable diversity, but the MIKC* type has only two subgroups, P- and S-clade, which show conserved expression in the gametophyte. To examine the functional conservation of MIKC*-type genes, we characterized all three rice (Oryza sativa) MIKC*-type genes. All three genes are specifically expressed late in pollen development. The single knockdown or knockout lines, respectively, of the S-clade MADS62 and MADS63 did not show a mutant phenotype, but lines in which both S-clade genes were affected showed severe defects in pollen maturation and germination, as did knockdown lines of MADS68, the only P-clade gene in rice. The rice MIKC*-type proteins form strong heterodimeric complexes solely with partners from the other subclade; these complexes specifically bind to N10-type C-A-rich-G-boxes in vitro and regulate downstream gene expression by binding to N10-type promoter motifs. The rice MIKC* genes have a much lower degree of functional redundancy than the Arabidopsis thaliana MIKC* genes. Nevertheless, our data indicate that the function of heterodimeric MIKC*-type protein complexes in pollen development has been conserved since the divergence of monocots and eudicots, roughly 150 million years ago.

AB  - Flowering and bud dormancy are crucial stages in the life cycle of perennial angiosperms in temperate climates. MADS-box family genes are involved in many plant growth and development processes. Here, we identified three MADS-box genes in tea plant belonging to the FLOWERING LOCUS C (CsFLC) family. We monitored CsFLC1 transcription throughout the year and found that CsFLC1 was expressed at a higher level during the winter bud dormancy and flowering phases. To clarify the function of CsFLC1, we developed transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants heterologously expressing 35S::CsFLC1. These lines bolted and bloomed earlier than the WT (Col-0), and the seed germination rate was inversely proportional to the increased CsFLC1 expression level. The RNA-seq of 35S::CsFLC1 transgenic Arabidopsis showed that many genes responding to ageing, flower development and leaf senescence were affected, and phytohormone-related pathways were especially enriched. According to the results of hormone content detection and RNA transcript level analysis, CsFLC1 controls flowering time possibly by regulating SOC1, AGL42, SEP3 and AP3 and hormone signaling, accumulation and metabolism. This is the first time a study has identified FLC-like genes and characterized CsFLC1 in tea plant. Our results suggest that CsFLC1 might play dual roles in flowering and winter bud dormancy and provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms of FLC in tea plants as well as other plant species.

AB  - SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) genes are members of the well-known MADS-box gene family that play a key role in regulating vital developmental processes in plants. Hemerocallis are perennial herbs that exhibit continuous flowering development and have been extensively used in landscaping. However, there are few reports on the regulatory mechanism of flowering in Hemerocallis. To better understand the molecular basis of floral formation of Hemerocallis, we identified and characterized the SVP-like gene HkSVP from the Hemerocallis cultivar 'Kanai Sensei'. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) indicated that HkSVP transcript was mainly expressed in the vegetative growth stage and had the highest expression in leaves, low expression in petals, pedicels and fruits, and no expression in pistils. The HkSVP encoded protein was localized in the nucleus of Arabidopsis protoplasts and the nucleus of onion epidermal cells. Yeast two hybrid assay revealed that HKSVP interacted with Hemerocallis AP1 and TFL1. Moreover, overexpression of HkSVP in Arabidopsis resulted in delayed flowering and abnormal phenotypes, including enriched trichomes, increased basal inflorescence branches and inhibition of inflorescence formation. These observations suggest that the HkSVP gene may play an important role in maintaining vegetative growth by participating in the construction of inflorescence structure and the development of flower organs.

AB  - Plants can develop root systems with distinct anatomical features and morphological plasticity to forage nutrients distributed heterogeneously in soils. Lateral root proliferation is a typical nutrient-foraging response to a local supply of nitrate, which has been investigated across many plant species. However, the underlying mechanism in maize roots remains largely unknown. Here, we report on identification of a maize truncated MIKC-type MADS-box transcription factor (ZmTMM1) lacking K- and C-domains, expressed preferentially in the lateral root branching zone and induced by the localized supply of nitrate. ZmTMM1 belongs to the AGL17-like MADS-box transcription factor family that contains orthologs of ANR1, a key regulator for root nitrate foraging in Arabidopsis. Ectopic overexpression of ZmTMM1 recovers the defective growth of lateral roots in the Arabidopsis anr1 agl21 double mutant. The local activation of glucocorticoid receptor fusion proteins for ZmTMM1 and an artificially truncated form of AtANR1 without the K- and C-domains stimulates the lateral root growth of the Arabidopsis anr1 agl21 mutant, providing evidence that ZmTMM1 encodes a functional MADS-box that modulates lateral root development. However, no phenotype was observed in ZmTMM1-RNAi transgenic maize lines, suggesting a possible genetic redundancy of ZmTMM1 with other AGL17-like genes in maize. A comparative genome analysis further suggests that a nitrate-inducible transcriptional regulation is probably conserved in both truncated and non-truncated forms of ZmTMM1-like MADS-box transcription factors found in grass species.

AB  - The lotus (Nelumbo Adans.) is an important aquatic plant with ornamental, medicinal and edible values and cultural connotations. It has single-, semi-double-, double- and thousand-petalled types of flower shape and is an ideal material for developmental research of flower doubling. The lotus is a basal eudicot species without a morphological difference between the sepals and petals and occupies a critical phylogenetic position in flowering plants. In order to investigate the genetic relationship between the sepals and petals in the lotus, the class E genes which affect sepal formation were focused on and analyzed. Here, SEPALLATA 1(NnSEP1) and its homologous genes AGAMOUS-LIKE MADS-BOXAGL9 (NnAGL9) and MADS-BOX TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 6-like (NnMADS6-like) of the class E gene family were isolated from the flower buds of the Asian lotus (Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn.). The protein structure, subcellular localization and expression patterns of these three genes were investigated. All three genes were verified to locate in the nucleus and had typical MADS-box characteristics. NnSEP1 and NnMADS6-like were specifically expressed in the sepals, while NnAGL9 was highly expressed in the petals, suggesting that different developmental mechanisms exist in the formation of the sepals and petals in the lotus. The significant functional differences between NnSEP1, NnMADS6-like and NnAGL9 were also confirmed by a yeast two-hybrid assay. These results expand our knowledge on the class E gene family in sepal formation and will benefit fundamental research on the development of floral organs in Nelumbo.

AB  - In Arabidopsis thaliana, the ability to flower is mainly related to a floral repressor, FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), which is regulated through the vernalization pathway. The genes controlling the vernalization pathway seem to be only partially conserved in dicots other than the Brassicaceae. Cichorium intybus (chicory) is a biennial species belonging to the Asteraceae family, and it shows an obligate vernalization requirement for flowering. Cichorium intybus MADS (MCM1, Agamous, Deficiens, SRF) FLC-like (CiMFL) sequences were isolated in C. intybus by RT-PCR and their expression patterns characterized during plant development and in response to vernalization. The biological function of CiMFL was analysed by complementation of A. thaliana FRIGIDA (AtFRI);flc3. Resetting of MFL expression after vernalization was analysed during microsporogenesis. Before vernalization, CiMFL is mainly expressed in the axils of young leaves. Vernalization induced CiMFL down-regulation under a long-day photoperiod but not under a short-day photoperiod. Furthermore, together with a decrease in CiMFL transcripts, cold conditions induced changes in the morphology of the shoot apical meristem and in the transition to flowering. The biological function of CiMFL was found not to be conserved. Our results show that the regulation of CiMFL expression in time and space and in relation to environmental conditions is only partially conserved with respect to FLC isolated from A. thaliana. A model for flowering repression by CiMFL is proposed.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Morphogenesis occurs through accurate interaction between essential players to generate highly specialized plant organs. Fruit structure and function are triggered by a neat transcriptional control involving distinct regulator genes encoding transcription factors (TFs) or signalling proteins, such as the C2H2/C2HC zinc-finger NO TRANSMITTING TRACT (NTT) or the MADS-box protein SEEDSTICK (STK), which are important in setting plant reproductive competence, feasibly by affecting cell wall polysaccharide and lipid distribution. Arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs) are major components of the cell wall and are thought to be involved in the reproductive process as important players in specific stages of development. The detection of AGPs epitopes in reproductive tissues of NTT and other fruit development-related TFs, such as MADS-box proteins including SHATTERPROOF1 (SHP1), SHP2 and STK, was the focus of this study. METHODS: We used fluorescence microscopy to perform immunolocalization analyses on stk and ntt single mutants, on the ntt stk double mutant and on the stk shp1 shp2 triple mutant using specific anti-AGP monoclonal antibodies. In these mutants, the expression levels of selected AGP genes were also measured by quantitative real-time PCR and compared with the respective expression in wild-type (WT) plants. KEY RESULTS: The present immunolocalization study collects information on the distribution patterns of specific AGPs in Arabidopsis female reproductive tissues, complemented by the quantification of AGP expression levels, comparing WT, stk and ntt single mutants, the ntt stk double mutant and the stk shp1 shp2 triple mutant. CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal distinct AGP distribution patterns in different developmental mutants related to the female reproductive unit in Arabidopsis. The value of the immunofluorescence labelling technique is highlighted in this study as an invaluable tool to dissect the remodelling nature of the cell wall in developmental processes.

AB  - Argan trees (Argania spinosa) belong to a species native to southwestern Morocco, playing an important role in the environment and local economy. Argan oil extracted from kernels has a unique composition and properties. Argan trees were introduced in Tunisia, where hundreds of trees can be found nowadays. In this study, we examined reproductive development in Argan trees from four sites in Tunisia and carried out the functional characterization of a floral homeotic gene in this non-model species. Despite the importance of reproductive development, nothing is known about the genetic network controlling flower development in Argania spinosa. Results obtained in several plant species established that floral organ development is mostly controlled by MADS-box genes and, in particular, APETALA3 (AP3) and PISTILLATA (PI) homologs are required for proper petal and stamen identity. Here, we describe the isolation and functional characterization of a MADS-box gene from Argania spinosa. Phylogenetic analyses showed strong homology with PI-like proteins, and the expression of the gene was found to be restricted to the second and third whorls. Functional homology with Arabidopsis PI was demonstrated by the ability of AsPI to confer petal and stamen identity when overexpressed in a pi-1 mutant background. The identification and characterization of this gene support the strong conservation of PI homologs among distant angiosperm plants.

AB  - Flower and fruit development in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. ) were severely affected when plants were grown at low temperatures, displaying homeotic and meristic transformations and alterations in the fusion pattern of the organs. Most of these homeotic transformations modified the identity of stamens and carpels, giving rise to intermediate organs. Complete homeotic transformations were rarely found and always affected organs of the reproductive whorls. Meristic transformations were also commonly observed in the reproductive whorls, which developed with an excessive number of organs. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that meristic transformations take place very early in the development of the flower and are related to a significant increase in the floral meristem size. However, homeotic transformations should occur later during the development of the organ primordia. Steady-state levels of transcripts corresponding to tomato MADS-box genes TM4, TM5, TM6, and TAG1 were greatly increased by low temperatures and could be related to these flower abnormalities. Moreover, in situ hybridization analyses showed that low temperatures also altered the stage-specific expression of TM4.

AB  - To investigate the cold response mechanism and low temperature regulation of flowering in tulips, this study identified 32 MADS-box transcription factor family members in tulips based on full-length transcriptome sequencing, named TgMADS1-TgMADS32. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that these genes can be divided into two classes: type I and type II. Structural analysis showed that TgMADS genes from different subfamilies have a similar distribution of conserved motifs. Quantitative real-time PCR results demonstrated that some TgMADS genes (e.g., TgMADS3, TgMADS15, TgMADS16, and TgMADS19) were significantly upregulated in buds and stems under cold conditions, implying their potential involvement in the cold response of tulips. In summary, this study systematically identified MADS family members in tulips and elucidated their evolutionary relationships, gene structures, and cold-responsive expression patterns, laying the foundation for further elucidating the roles of these transcription factors in flowering and the cold adaptability of tulips.

AB  - MADS-box genes, which encode highly conserved DNA-binding transcriptional factors, can regulate developmental processes in plants. FaMADS1a has not been functionally analyzed in non-climacteric fruit to date. In this study, one strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa) MADS-box gene, FaMADS1a, was cloned and its tissue-specific expression profiles were analyzed. FaMADS1a expressed in petal and fruit, and its expression levels decreased significantly during fruit ripening. Multiple sequence alignments suggested that FaMADS1a protein exhibited conserved MADS_MEF2_like motif, K-box region, MADS domain, SRF-TF motif and ARG80 domain. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that FaMADS1a belonged to the SEP1/2 clade. Phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) suppressed FaMADS1a expression but accelerated the ripening process and anthocyanin-related gene expressions, while indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) induced FaMADS1a expression with delayed ripening phenotype and reduced expressions of anthocyanin-related genes. The pBI121 vector-mediated over-expression of FaMADS1a reduced the expressions of four anthocyanin-related genes and delayed fruit ripening compared to the control. Results suggested that FaMADS1a played a negative role in anthocyanin accumulation of strawberry fruit via repressing FaPAL6, FaCHS, FaDFR and FaANS.

AB  - The unique capitulum of Asteraceae has important ornamental and research value. Few studies have described the complex molecular mechanism of flower development. In this study, SvGLOBOSA(SvGLO), the MADS-box gene of Senecio vulgaris, was identified by screening the transcriptome data, and its function was examined. The gene structure was analyzed and its function was predicted through bioinformatics. The relative expression levels in different tissues of wild-type S. vulgaris were analyzed by qRT-PCR. SvGLO was overexpressed in Solanum nigrum and morphological observations were made. Histological staining was used in analyzing the histological changes in the ovary of transgenic S. nigrum. The results showed that the open reading frame of SvGLO was 591 bp long, encoding 196 amino acids. It has typical MADS-box and K-box domains and contains a PI motif at the C-terminal. SvGLO belongs to the PI/GLO subfamily of class B MADS-box genes. qRT-PCR results showed that SvGLO was highly expressed in inflorescence tissues but not in vegetative organs. In SvGLO-overexpressed S. nigrum, the sepals showed some characteristics of petals, carpels transformed into stamen-like organs, and fruit development was abnormal. Histological staining revealed that the morphology of ovary wall cells of transgenic S. nigrum was similar to that of anther wall cells of the stamen of wild-type S. vulgaris. Therefore, SvGLO may be involved in the regulation of petal and stamen development in S. vulgaris.

AB  - The molecular basis of orchid flower development is accomplished through a specific regulatory program in which the class B MADS-box AP3/DEF genes play a central role. In particular, the differential expression of four class B AP3/DEF genes is responsible for specification of organ identities in the orchid perianth. Other MADS-box genes (AGL6 and SEP-like) enrich the molecular program underpinning the orchid perianth development, resulting in the expansion of the original "orchid code" in an even more complex gene regulatory network. To identify candidates that could interact with the AP3/DEF genes in orchids, we conducted an in silico differential expression analysis in wild-type and peloric Phalaenopsis. The results suggest that a YABBY DL-like gene could be involved in the molecular program leading to the development of the orchid perianth, particularly the labellum. Two YABBY DL/CRC homologs are present in the genome of Phalaenopsis equestris, PeDL1 and PeDL2, and both express two alternative isoforms. Quantitative real-time PCR analyses revealed that both genes are expressed in column and ovary. In addition, PeDL2 is more strongly expressed the labellum than in the other tepals of wild-type flowers. This pattern is similar to that of the AP3/DEF genes PeMADS3/4 and opposite to that of PeMADS2/5. In peloric mutant Phalaenopsis, where labellum-like structures substitute the lateral inner tepals, PeDL2 is expressed at similar levels of the PeMADS2-5 genes, suggesting the involvement of PeDL2 in the development of the labellum, together with the PeMADS2-PeMADS5 genes. Although the yeast two-hybrid analysis did not reveal the ability of PeDL2 to bind the PeMADS2-PeMADS5 proteins directly, the existence of regulatory interactions is suggested by the presence of CArG-boxes and other MADS-box transcription factor binding sites within the putative promoter of the orchid DL2 gene.

AB  - The MADS-box genes encode transcriptional regulators with various functions especially during floral development. A total of 54 putative Morus notabilis MADS-box genes (MnMADSs) were identified and phylogenetically classified as either type I (17 genes) or type II (37 genes). The detected genes included three FLOWERING LOCUS C-like (MnFLC-like) genes, MnMADS33, MnMADS50, and MnMADS7. MnFLC-like proteins could directly or indirectly repress promoter activity of the mulberry FLOWERING LOCUS T-like (MnFT) gene. Transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana overexpressing MnFLC-like genes exhibited delayed flowering and down-regulated expression of FT and SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS1 (SOC1). The gene expression analyses in floral bud indicated that MnMADS33 expression increased, while MnFT expression decreased during the induction of dormancy in response to cold conditions. Dormancy release resulted in the down-regulation of MnMADS33 expression and the up-regulation of MnFT expression. Furthermore, abscisic acid promoted the transcription of MnMADS33 and MnFT, although the expression level of MnFT gradually decreased. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that MnMADS33 negatively regulated the expression of MnFT to repress dormancy release and flowering in mulberry. This study may be relevant for future investigations regarding the effects of MnMADS genes on mulberry flowering development.

AB  - Wild-type tomato plants bear unbranched inflorescences with jointed pedicels. Branched inflorescences produce more flowers and, presumably, more fruits. However, excessively branched variants exhibit sterility and are avoided by breeders. Compared to jointed pedicels, jointless pedicels enhance fruit retention and facilitate machine harvesting. A desirable tomato inflorescence is thus weakly branched with jointless pedicels. Although a range of inflorescence variants exist in tomato germplasm, our understanding of the genetic programme controlling inflorescence architecture has remained limited, hindering effective breeding. By exploring branched tomato variants, Sebastian Soyk, from the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, and colleagues uncovered two artificially selected MADS-box genes that control meristem maturation and inflorescence development.

AB  - The reproductive transition is an important event that is crucial for plant survival and reproduction. Relative to the thorough understanding of the vegetative phase transition in angiosperms, a little is known about this process in perennial conifers. To gain insight into the molecular basis of the regulatory mechanism in conifers, we used temporal dynamic transcriptome analysis with samples from seven different ages of Pinus tabuliformis to identify a gene module substantially associated with aging. The results first demonstrated that the phase change in P. tabuliformis occurred as an unexpectedly rapid transition rather than a slow, gradual progression. The age-related gene module contains 33 transcription factors and was enriched in genes that belong to the MADS (MCMl, AGAMOUS, DEFICIENS, SRF)-box family, including six SOC1-like genes and DAL1 and DAL10. Expression analysis in P. tabuliformis and a late-cone-setting P. bungeana mutant showed a tight association between PtMADS11 and reproductive competence. We then confirmed that MADS11 and DAL1 coordinate the aging pathway through physical interaction. Overexpression of PtMADS11 and PtDAL1 partially rescued the flowering of 35S::miR156A and spl1,2,3,4,5,6 mutants in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), but only PtMADS11 could rescue the flowering of the ft-10 mutant, suggesting PtMADS11 and PtDAL1 play different roles in flowering regulatory networks in Arabidopsis. The PtMADS11 could not alter the flowering phenotype of soc1-1-2, indicating it may function differently from AtSOC1 in Arabidopsis. In this study, we identified the MADS11 gene in pine as a regulatory mediator of the juvenile-to-adult transition with functions differentiated from the angiosperm SOC1.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The functional specialization of microRNA and its target genes is often an important factor in the establishment of spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression that are essential to plant development and growth. In different plant lineages, understanding the functional conservation and divergence of microRNAs remains to be explored. METHODS: To identify small regulatory RNAs underlying floral patterning, we performed a tissue-specific profiling of small RNAs in various floral organs from single and double flower varieties (flowers characterized by multiple layers of petals) in Camellia japonica. We identified cja-miR5179, which belongs to a deeply conserved microRNA family that is conserved between angiosperms and basal plants but frequently lost in eudicots. We characterized the molecular function of cja-miR5179 and its target - a B-function MADS-box gene - through gene expression analysis and transient expression assays. KEY RESULTS: We showed that cja-miR5179 is exclusively expressed in ovule tissues at the early stage of floral development. We found that cja-miR5179 targets the coding sequences of a DEFICIENS-like B-class gene (CjDEF) mRNA, which is located in the K motif of the MADS-box domain; and the target sites of miR5179/MADS-box were consistent in Camellia and orchids. Furthermore, through a petal transient-expression assay, we showed that the BASIC PENTACYSTEINE proteins bind to the GA-rich motifs in the cja-miR5179 promoter region and suppresses its expression. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that the regulation between miR5179 and a B-class MADS-box gene in C. japonica has a deep evolutionary origin before the separation of monocots and dicots. During floral development of C. japonica, cja-miR5179 is specifically expressed in the ovule, which may be required for the inhibition of CjDEF function. This work highlights the evolutionary conservation as well as functional divergence of small RNAs in floral development.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The architecture of inflorescence and the development of floral organs can influence the yield of seeds and have a significant impact on plant propagation. E-class floral homeotic MADS-box genes exhibit important roles in regulation of floral transition and differentiation of floral organs. Woad (Isatis indigotica) possesses unique inflorescence, floral organs and fruit. However, very little research has been carried out to determine the function of MADS-box genes in this medicinal cruciferous plant species. RESULTS: SEPALLATA orthologs in I. indigotica were cloned by degenerate PCR. The sequence possessing the highest identity with SEP2 and SEP4 of Arabidopsis were named as IiSEP2 and IiSEP4, respectively. Constitutive expression of IiSEP2 in Columbia (Col-0) ecotype of Arabidopsis led to early flowering, and the number of the flowers and the lateral branches was reduced, indicating an alteration in architecture of the inflorescences. Moreover, the number of the floral organs was declined, the sepals were turned into carpelloid tissues bearing stigmatic papillae and ovules, and secondary flower could be produced in apetalous terminal flowers. In 35S::IiSEP4-GFP transgenic Arabidopsis plants in Landsberg erecta (Ler) genetic background, the number of the floral organs was decreased, sepals were converted into curly carpelloid structures, accompanied by generation of ovules. Simultaneously, the size of petals, stamens and siliques was diminished. In 35S::IiSEP4-GFP transgenic plants of apetalous ap1 cal double mutant in Ler genetic background, the cauliflower phenotype was attenuated significantly, and the petal formation could be rescued. Occasionally, chimeric organs composed of petaloid and sepaloid tissues, or petaloid and stamineous tissues, were produced in IiSEP4 transgenic plants of apl cal double mutant. It suggested that overexpression of IiSEP4 could restore the capacity in petal differentiation. Silencing of IiSEP4 by Virus-Induced Gene Silencing (VIGS) can delay the flowering time, and reduce the number and size of the floral organs in woad flowers. CONCLUSION: All the results showed that SEPALLATA-like genes could influence the architecture of the inflorescence and the determinacy of the floral meristems, and was also related to development of the floral organs.

AB  - APETALA3 (AP3) and PISTILLATA (PI) are B-class MADS-box floral homeotic genes of Arabidopsis and are involved in specifying the identity of petals and stamens. In the present work, IiAP3 and IiPI, the respective orthologous genes of AP3 and PI, were cloned from Isatis indigotica. By expressing in ap3-6 and pi-1 homozygous mutant and in wild-type Arabidopsis under the control of AP3 promoter or CaMV 35S promoter, we demonstrated that IiAP3 and IiPI were functionally equivalent to AP3 and PI of Arabidopsis. Referring to previous reports and the research results in the present work, expression patterns of AP3 and PI homologs are not the same in different angiosperms possessing diverse floral structures. It suggests that the alterations in expression may contribute to the changing morphology of flowers. To further determine the relationship between IiAP3 and IiPI, the coding sequences of the different structural regions in these two proteins were swapped with each other, and the data collected from transgenic Arabidopsis plants of the chimeric constructs suggested that MADS domain was irreplaceable for the function of IiAP3, K domain of IiAP3 was involved in specifying the identity of stamens, K domain of IiPI was mainly related to the formation of petals, and C-terminal region of IiPI was involved in characterization of stamens. In addition, a complete KC region of these two proteins was more effective in phenotypic complementation of the mutants.

AB  - Pathogens that rely upon multiple hosts to complete their life cycles often modify behavior and development of these hosts to coerce them into improving pathogen fitness. However, few studies describe mechanisms underlying host coercion. In this study, we elucidate the mechanism by which an insect-transmitted pathogen of plants alters floral development to convert flowers into vegetative tissues. We find that phytoplasma produce a novel effector protein (SAP54) that interacts with members of the MADS-domain transcription factor (MTF) family, including key regulators SEPALLATA3 and APETALA1, that occupy central positions in the regulation of floral development. SAP54 mediates degradation of MTFs by interacting with proteins of the RADIATION SENSITIVE23 (RAD23) family, eukaryotic proteins that shuttle substrates to the proteasome. Arabidopsis rad23 mutants do not show conversion of flowers into leaf-like tissues in the presence of SAP54 and during phytoplasma infection, emphasizing the importance of RAD23 to the activity of SAP54. Remarkably, plants with SAP54-induced leaf-like flowers are more attractive for colonization by phytoplasma leafhopper vectors and this colonization preference is dependent on RAD23. An effector that targets and suppresses flowering while simultaneously promoting insect herbivore colonization is unprecedented. Moreover, RAD23 proteins have, to our knowledge, no known roles in flower development, nor plant defence mechanisms against insects. Thus SAP54 generates a short circuit between two key pathways of the host to alter development, resulting in sterile plants, and promotes attractiveness of these plants to leafhopper vectors helping the obligate phytoplasmas reproduce and propagate (zombie plants).

AB  - Responses to environmental cues synchronize reproduction of higher plants to the changing seasons. The genetic basis of these responses has been intensively studied in the Brassicaceae. The MADS-domain transcription factor FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) plays a central role in the regulatory network that controls flowering of Arabidopsis thaliana in response to seasonal cues. FLC blocks flowering until its transcription is stably repressed by extended exposure to low temperatures in autumn or winter and, therefore, FLC activity is assumed to limit flowering to spring. Recent reviews describe the complex epigenetic mechanisms responsible for FLC repression in cold. We focus on the gene regulatory networks controlled by FLC and how they influence floral transition. Genome-wide approaches determined the in vivo target genes of FLC and identified those whose transcription changes during vernalization or in flc mutants. We describe how studying FLC targets such as FLOWERING LOCUS T, SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE 15, and TARGET OF FLC AND SVP 1 can explain different flowering behaviours in response to vernalization and other environmental cues, and help define mechanisms by which FLC represses gene transcription. Elucidating the gene regulatory networks controlled by FLC provides access to the developmental and physiological mechanisms that regulate floral transition.

AB  - The timing of reproduction is an adaptive trait in many organisms. In plants, the timing, duration, and intensity of flowering differ between annual and perennial species. To identify interspecies variation in these traits, we studied introgression lines derived from hybridization of annual and perennial species, Arabis montbretiana and Arabis alpina, respectively. Recombination mapping identified two tandem A. montbretiana genes encoding MADS-domain transcription factors that confer extreme late flowering on A. alpina These genes are related to the MADS AFFECTING FLOWERING (MAF) cluster of floral repressors of other Brassicaceae species and were named A. montbretiana (Am) MAF-RELATED (MAR) genes. AmMAR1 but not AmMAR2 prevented floral induction at the shoot apex of A. alpina, strongly enhancing the effect of the MAF cluster, and MAR1 is absent from the genomes of all A. alpina accessions analyzed. Exposure of plants to cold (vernalization) represses AmMAR1 transcription and overcomes its inhibition of flowering. Assembly of the tandem arrays of MAR and MAF genes of six A. alpina accessions and three related species using PacBio long-sequence reads demonstrated that the MARs arose within the Arabis genus by interchromosomal transposition of a MAF1-like gene followed by tandem duplication. Time-resolved comparative RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) suggested that AmMAR1 may be retained in A. montbretiana to enhance the effect of the AmMAF cluster and extend the duration of vernalization required for flowering. Our results demonstrate that MAF genes transposed independently in different Brassicaceae lineages and suggest that they were retained to modulate adaptive flowering responses that differ even among closely related species.

AB  - The Orchidaceae is a mega-diverse plant family with ca. 29,000 species with a large variety of life forms that can colonize transitory habitats. Despite this diversity, little is known about their flowering integrators in response to specific environmental factors. During the reproductive transition in flowering plants a vegetative apical meristem (SAM) transforms into an inflorescence meristem (IM) that forms bracts and flowers. In model grasses, like rice, a flowering genetic regulatory network (FGRN) controlling reproductive transitions has been identified, but little is known in the Orchidaceae. In order to analyze the players of the FRGN in orchids, we performed comprehensive phylogenetic analyses of CONSTANS-like/CONSTANS-like 4 (COL/COL4), FLOWERING LOCUS D (FD), FLOWERING LOCUS C/FRUITFULL (FLC/FUL) and SUPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 (SOC1) gene lineages. In addition to PEBP and AGL24/SVP genes previously analyzed, here we identify an increase of orchid homologs belonging to COL4, and FUL gene lineages in comparison with other monocots, including grasses, due to orchid-specific gene lineage duplications. Contrariwise, local duplications in Orchidaceae are less frequent in the COL, FD and SOC1 gene lineages, which points to a retention of key functions under strong purifying selection in essential signaling factors. We also identified changes in the protein sequences after such duplications, variation in the evolutionary rates of resulting paralogous clades and targeted expression of isolated homologs in different orchids. Interestingly, vernalization-response genes like VERNALIZATION1 (VRN1) and FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) are completely lacking in orchids, or alternatively are reduced in number, as is the case of VERNALIZATION2/GHD7 (VRN2). Our findings point to non-canonical factors sensing temperature changes in orchids during reproductive transition. Expression data of key factors gathered from Elleanthus auratiacus, a terrestrial orchid in high Andean mountains allow us to characterize which copies are actually active during flowering. Altogether, our data lays down a comprehensive framework to assess gene function of a restricted number of homologs identified more likely playing key roles during the flowering transition, and the changes of the FGRN in neotropical orchids in comparison with temperate grasses.

AB  - Plant pathogens alter the course of plant developmental processes, resulting in abnormal morphology in infected host plants. Phytoplasmas are unique plant-pathogenic bacteria that transform plant floral organs into leaf-like structures and cause the emergence of secondary flowers. These distinctive symptoms have attracted considerable interest for many years. Here, we revealed the molecular mechanisms of the floral symptoms by focusing on a phytoplasma-secreted protein, PHYL1, which induces morphological changes in flowers that are similar to those seen in phytoplasma-infected plants. PHYL1 is a homolog of the phytoplasmal effector SAP54 that also alters floral development. Using yeast two-hybrid and in planta transient co-expression assays, we found that PHYL1 interacts with and degrades the floral homeotic MADS domain proteins SEPALLATA3 (SEP3), APETALA1 (AP1) and CAULIFLOWER (CAL). This degradation of MADS domain proteins was dependent on the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The expression of floral development genes downstream of SEP3 and AP1 was disrupted in 35S::PHYL1 transgenic plants. PHYL1 was genetically and functionally conserved among other phytoplasma strains and species. We designate PHYL1, SAP54 and their homologs as members of the phyllody-inducing gene family of 'phyllogens'.

AB  - Members of the SEPALLATA (SEP) gene sub-family encode class E floral homeotic MADS-domain transcription factors (MADS TFs) that specify the identity of floral organs. The Arabidopsis thaliana genome contains 4 ancestrally duplicated and functionally redundant SEP genes, SEP1-4. Recently, a gene family of unique effectors, phyllogens, was identified as an inducer of leaf-like floral organs in phytoplasmas (plant pathogenic bacteria). While it was shown that phyllogens target some MADS TFs, including SEP3 for degradation, it is unknown whether the other SEPs (SEP1, SEP2, and SEP4) of Arabidopsis are also degraded by them. In this study, we found that all 4 SEP proteins of Arabidopsis are degraded by a phyllogen using a transient co-expression assay in Nicotiana benthamiana. This finding indicates that phyllogens may broadly target class E MADS TFs of plants.

AB  - Transcription factors are crucial for plant growth and development. MADS-box, WRKY, NAC, and SBP-box, some of the most vital transcription factors, are not well identified in Diospyros spp., and their floral development and sex differentiation related functions remain unknown. We identified and analysed 53 MADS-box, 66 WRKY, 83 NAC, and 17 SBP-box transcription factors using the chromosomal D. oleifera genome. There were six DolSBPs identified as miR156 and miR157 targets. According to the multiple sequence alignments of Arabidopsis and D. oleifera proteins and their conserved domains and motifs, DolMADSs were divided into 23 type I and 30 type II. The DolWRKYs, DolNACs, and DolSBPs were divided into 7, 16, and 6 subgroups, respectively. It was found that one DolMADS, five DolWRKYs, one DolNAC, and four DolSBPs may promote unisexual female flowers development, while three DolMADSs, four DolWRKYs, and one DolNAC may enhance unisexual male flowers development. The functions among the different members of the same family may, thus, vary widely. The results will help to elucidate the evolution of the MADS-box, WRKY, NAC, and SBP-box genes families in D. oleifera and to determine their functions in flower development for Diospyros spp.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A commonly used approach to study the interaction of two proteins of interest (POIs) in vivo is measuring Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET). This requires the expression of the two POIs fused to two fluorescent proteins that function as a FRET pair. A precise way to record FRET is Fluorescence Lifetime IMaging (FLIM) which generates quantitative data that, in principle, can be used to resolve both complex structure and protein affinities. However, this potential resolution is often lost in many experimental approaches. Here we introduce a novel tool for FLIM data analysis of multiexponential decaying donor fluorophores, one pattern analysis (OPA), which allows to obtain information about protein affinity and complex arrangement by extracting the relative amplitude of the FRET component and the FRET transfer efficiency from other FRET parameters. RESULTS: As a proof of concept for OPA, we used FLIM-FRET, or FLIM-FRET in combination with BiFC to reassess the dimerization and tetramerization properties of known interacting MADS-domain transcription factors in Nicotiana benthamiana leaf cells and Arabidopsis thaliana flowers. Using the OPA tool and by extracting protein BINDING efficiencies from FRET parameters to dissect MADS-domain protein interactions in vivo in transient N. benthamiana experiments, we could show that MADS-domain proteins display similar proximities within dimeric or tetrameric complexes but bind with variable affinities. By combining FLIM with BiFC, we were able to identify SEPALLATA3 as a mediator for tetramerization between the other MADS-domain factors. OPA also revealed that in vivo expression from native promoters at low levels in Arabidopsis flower meristems, makes in situ complex formation of MADS-domain proteins barely detectable. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that MADS-domain protein interactions are transient in situ and may involve additional, so far unknown interaction mediators. We conclude that OPA can be used to separate protein binding from information about proximity and orientation of the interacting proteins in their complexes. Visualization of individual protein interactions within the underlying interaction networks in the native environment is still restrained if expression levels are low and will require continuous improvements in fluorophore labelling, instrumentation set-ups and analysis tools.

AB  - Despite the wide appreciation of seedless grapes, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that drive the stenospermocarpic seedless-type phenotype in grapevine. In order to address the molecular mechanisms that control seedlessness in grapevine, our study aimed to characterize VviAGL11, a class D MADS-box transcription factor gene that has been proposed as the major candidate gene involved in Vitis vinifera seed morphogenesis. VviAGL11 allelic variations in seeded and seedless grapevine cultivars were determined, and its correlations with allele-specific steady-state mRNA levels were investigated. VviAGL11 relative expression was significantly higher in seeds at 2, 4, and 6 weeks after fruit set, whereas in the seedless grape its transcript levels were extremely low in all stages analyzed. In situ hybridization revealed transcript accumulation specifically in the dual endotesta layer of the seeds, which is responsible for elongation and an increase of cell number, a necessary step to determine the lignification and the final seed size. No hybridization signals were visible in the seedless grapevine tissues, and a morphoanatomical analysis showed an apparent loss of identity of the endotesta layer of the seed traces. Ectopic expression of VviAGL11 in the Arabidopsis SEEDSTICK mutant background restored the wild-type phenotype and confirmed the direct role of VviAGL11 in seed morphogenesis, suggesting that depletion of its expression is responsible for the erroneous development of a highly essential seed layer, therefore culminating in the typical apirenic phenotype.

AB  - MADS box genes encode putative transcription factors that play important roles in plant and animal development. In plants, MADS box genes are involved in the early step of specifying floral meristem identity as well as the later step of determining the fate of floral organ primordia. Here, we describe the isolation and characterization of a new MADS box gene from Arabidopsis, designated AGL8. Although AGL8 RNA does not accumulate during vegetative growth, it accumulates to high levels in the inflorescence apical meristem as well as in the inflorescence stem and cauline leaves. AGL8 RNA is excluded from the young flower primordia that arise on the flanks of the inflorescence meristem but later accumulates in the walls of the developing carpels. The lack of AGL8 RNA in floral meristems is due in part to the action of another MADS box gene, APETALA1, because AGL8 RNA does accumulate in apetala1 mutant flower primordia.

AB  - Abscission is a universal and dynamic process in plants whereby organs such as leaves, flowers and fruit are shed, both during normal development, and in response to tissue damage and stress. Shedding occurs by separation of cells in anatomically distinct regions of the plant, called abscission zones (AZs). During abscission, the plant hormone ethylene stimulates cells to produce enzymes that degrade the middle lamella between cells in the AZ. The physiology and regulation of abscission at fully developed AZs is well known, but the molecular biology underlying their development is not. Here we report the first isolation of a gene directly involved in the development of a functional plant AZ. Tomato plants with the jointless mutation fail to develop AZs on their pedicels and so abscission of flowers or fruit does not occur normally. We identify JOINTLESS as a new MADS-box gene in a distinct phylogenetic clade separate from those functioning in floral organs. We propose that a deletion in JOINTLESS accounts for the failure of activation of pedicel AZ development in jointless tomato plants.

AB  - The MADS-box family, a substantial group of plant transcription factors, crucially regulates plant growth and development. Although the functions of AGL12-like subgroups have been elucidated in Arabidopsis, rice, and walnut, their roles in grapes remain unexplored. In this study, we isolated VvAGL12, a member of the grape MADS-box group, and investigated its impact on plant growth and biomass production. VvAGL12 was found to localize in the nucleus and exhibit expression in both vegetative and reproductive organs. We introduced VvAGL12 into Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia-0 and an agl12 mutant. The resulting phenotypes in the agl12 mutant, complementary line, and overexpressed line underscored VvAGL12's ability to promote early flowering, augment plant growth, and enhance production. This was evident from the improved fresh weight, root length, plant height, and seed production, as well as the reduced flowering time. Subsequent transcriptome analysis revealed significant alterations in the expression of genes associated with cell-wall modification and flowering in the transgenic plants. In summary, the findings highlight VvAGL12's pivotal role in the regulation of flowering timing, overall plant growth, and development. This study offers valuable insights, serving as a reference for understanding the influence of the VvAGL12 gene in other plant species and addressing yield-related challenges.

AB  - The floral quartet model proposes that plant MADS box proteins function as higher order tetrameric complexes. However, in planta evidence for MADS box tetramers remains scarce. Here, we applied a strategy using in vivo fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) based on the distance change and distance symmetry of stable tetrameric complexes in tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) leaf cells to improve the accuracy of the estimation of heterotetrameric complex formation. This measuring system precisely verified the stable state of Arabidopsis petal (AP3/PI/SEP3/AP1) and stamen (AP3/PI/SEP3/AG) complexes and showed that the lily (Lilium longiflorum) PI co-orthologs LMADS8 and LMADS9 likely formed heterotetrameric petal complexes with Arabidopsis AP3/SEP3/AP1, which rescued petal defects of pi mutants. However, L8/L9 did not form heterotetrameric stamen complexes with Arabidopsis AP3/SEP3/AG to rescue the stamen defects of the pi mutants. Importantly, this system was applied successfully to find complicated tepal and stamen heterotetrameric complexes in lily. We found that heterodimers of B function AP3/PI orthologs (L1/L8) likely coexist with the homodimers of PI orthologs (L8/L8, L9/L9) to form five (two most stable and three stable) tepal- and four (one most stable and three stable) stamen-related heterotetrameric complexes with A/E and C/E function proteins in lily. Among these combinations, L1 preferentially interacted with L8 to form the most stable heterotetrameric complexes, and the importance of the L8/L8 and L9/L9 homodimers in tepal/stamen formation in lily likely decreased to a minor part during evolution. The system provides substantial improvements for successfully estimating the existence of unknown tetrameric complexes in plants.

AB  - Spilocea oleagina is a dangerous obligate fungal pathogen of olive, feared in the Mediterranean countries, causing Peacock's eye or leaf spot infection, which can lead to a serious yield loss of approximately 20% or higher depending on climatic conditions. Coping with this disease is much more problematic for organic farms. To date, knowledge on the genetic control of possible mechanisms of resistance/low susceptibility is quite limited. In this work, comparative transcriptomic analysis (RNA-seq) was conducted in leaf tissues of a low susceptible cultivar Koroneiki and a high susceptible cultivar Nocellara del Belice, both tested in the field using the NaOH test, considering two stages-"zero sign of disease" and "evident sign of infection". Cultivars showed a very large number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in both stages. 'Koroneiki' showed an extensive hormonal crosstalk, involving Abscisic acid (ABA) and ethylene synergistically acting with Jasmonate, with early signaling of the disease and remarkable defense responses against Spilocea through the over-expression of many resistance gene analogs or pathogenesis-related (PR) genes: non-specific lipid-transfer genes (nsLTPs), LRR receptor-like serine/threonine-protein kinase genes, GDSL esterase lipase, defensin Ec-AMP-D2-like, pathogenesis-related leaf protein 6-like, Thaumatin-like gene, Mildew resistance Locus O (MLO) gene, glycine-rich protein (GRP), MADS-box genes, STH-21-like, endochitinases, glucan endo-1,3-beta-glucosidases, and finally, many proteinases. Numerous genes involved in cell wall biogenesis, remodeling, and cell wall-based defense, including lignin synthesis, were also upregulated in the resistant cultivar, indicating the possible role of wall composition in disease resistance. It was remarkable that many transcription factors (TS), some of which involved in Induced Systemic Resistance (ISR), as well as some also involved in abiotic stress response, were found to be uniquely expressed in 'Koroneiki', while 'Nocellara del Belice' was lacking an effective system of defense, expressing genes that overlap with wounding responses, and, to a minor extent, genes related to phenylpropanoid and terpenoid pathways. Only a Thaumatin-like gene was found in both cultivars showing a similar expression. In this work, the genetic factors and mechanism underlying the putative resistance trait against this fungal pathogen were unraveled for the first time and possible target genes for breeding resistant olive genotypes were found.

AB  - Fruit ripening is a complex developmental process responsible for the transformation of the seed-containing organ into a tissue attractive to seed dispersers and agricultural consumers. The coordinated regulation of the different biochemical pathways necessary to achieve this change receives considerable research attention. The MADS-box transcription factor RIPENING INHIBITOR (RIN) is an essential regulator of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) fruit ripening but the exact mechanism by which it influences the expression of ripening-related genes remains unclear. Using a chromatin immunoprecipitation approach, we provide evidence that RIN interacts with the promoters of genes involved in the major pathways associated with observed and well-studied ripening phenotypes and phenomena, including the transcriptional control network involved in overall ripening regulation, ethylene biosynthesis, ethylene perception, downstream ethylene response, cell wall metabolism, and carotenoid biosynthesis. Furthermore, in the cases of ethylene and carotenoid biosynthesis, RIN interacts with the promoters of genes encoding rate-limiting activities. We also show that RIN recruitment to target loci is dependent on a normally functioning allele at the ripening-specific transcription factor COLORLESS NONRIPENING gene locus, further clarifying the relationship between these two ripening regulators.

AB  - The B-class of MADS-box transcription factors has been studied in many plant species, but remains functionally uncharacterized in Rosaceae. APETALA3 (AP3), a member of this class, controls petal and stamen identities in Arabidopsis. In this study, we identified two members of the AP3 lineage in cultivated strawberry, Fragaria x ananassa, namely FaAP3 and FaTM6. FaTM6, and not FaAP3, showed an expression pattern equivalent to that of AP3 in Arabidopsis. We used the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system for the first time in an octoploid species to characterize the function of TM6 in strawberry flower development. An analysis by high-throughput sequencing of the FaTM6 locus spanning the target sites showed highly efficient genome editing already present in the T0 generation. Phenotypic characterization of the mutant lines indicated that FaTM6 plays a key role in anther development in strawberry. Our results validate the use of the CRISPR/Cas9 system for gene functional analysis in F. x ananassa as an octoploid species, and offer new opportunities for engineering strawberry to improve traits of interest in breeding programs.

AB  - Gene duplication is a substrate of evolution. However, the relative importance of positive selection versus relaxation of constraints in the functional divergence of gene copies is still under debate. Plant MADS-box genes encode transcriptional regulators key in various aspects of development and have undergone extensive duplications to form a large family. We recovered 104 MADS sequences from the Arabidopsis genome. Bayesian phylogenetic trees recover type II lineage as a monophyletic group and resolve a branching sequence of monophyletic groups within this lineage. The type I lineage is comprised of several divergent groups. However, contrasting gene structure and patterns of chromosomal distribution between type I and II sequences suggest that they had different evolutionary histories and support the placement of the root of the gene family between these two groups. Site-specific and site-branch analyses of positive Darwinian selection (PDS) suggest that different selection regimes could have affected the evolution of these lineages. We found evidence for PDS along the branch leading to flowering time genes that have a direct impact on plant fitness. Sites with high probabilities of having been under PDS were found in the MADS and K domains, suggesting that these played important roles in the acquisition of novel functions during MADS-box diversification. Detected sites are targets for further experimental analyses. We argue that adaptive changes in MADS-domain protein sequences have been important for their functional divergence, suggesting that changes within coding regions of transcriptional regulators have influenced phenotypic evolution of plants.

AB  - The end of the reproductive phase in monocarpic plants is determined by a coordinated arrest of all active meristems, a process known as global proliferative arrest (GPA). GPA is linked to the correlative control exerted by developing seeds and, possibly, the establishment of strong source-sink relationships. It has been proposed that the meristems that undergo arrest at the end of the reproductive phase behave at the transcriptomic level as dormant meristems, with low mitotic activity and high expression of abscisic acid response genes. Meristem arrest is also controlled genetically. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), the MADS-box transcription factor FRUITFULL induces GPA by directly repressing genes of the APETALA2 (AP2) clade. The AP2 genes maintain shoot apical meristem (SAM) activity in part by keeping WUSCHEL expression active, but the mechanisms downstream of this pathway remain elusive. To identify target genes, we performed a transcriptomic analysis, inducing AP2 activity in meristems close to arrest. Our results suggest that AP2 controls meristem arrest by repressing genes related to axillary bud dormancy in the SAM and negative regulators of cytokinin signaling. In addition, our analysis indicates that genes involved in the response to environmental signals also respond to AP2, suggesting that it could modulate the end of flowering by controlling responses to both endogenous and exogenous signals. Our results support the previous observation that at the end of the reproductive phase the arrested SAM behaves as a dormant meristem, and they strongly support AP2 as a master regulator of this process.

AB  - The regulation of floral organ identity was investigated using a forward genetic approach in five floral homeotic mutants of Thalictrum, a noncore eudicot. We hypothesized that these mutants carry defects in the floral patterning genes. Mutant characterization comprised comparative floral morphology and organ identity gene expression at early and late developmental stages, followed by sequence analysis of coding and intronic regions to identify transcription factor binding sites and protein-protein interaction (PPI) motifs. Mutants exhibited altered expression of floral MADS-box genes, which further informed the function of paralogs arising from gene duplications not found in reference model systems. The ensuing modified BCE models for the mutants supported instances of neofunctionalization (e.g., B-class genes expressed ectopically in sepals), partial redundancy (E-class), or subfunctionalization (C-class) of paralogs. A lack of deleterious mutations in the coding regions of candidate floral MADS-box genes suggested that cis-regulatory or trans-acting mutations are at play. Consistent with this hypothesis, double-flower mutants had transposon insertions or showed signs of transposon activity in the regulatory intron of AGAMOUS (AG) orthologs. Single amino acid substitutions were also found, yet they did not fall on any of the identified DNA binding or PPI motifs. In conclusion, we present evidence suggesting that transposon activity and regulatory mutations in floral homeotic genes likely underlie the striking phenotypes of these Thalictrum floral homeotic mutants.

AB  - PREMISE: Floral spurs are key innovations associated with elaborate pollination mechanisms that have evolved independently several times across angiosperms. Spur formation can shift the floral symmetry from radial to bilateral, as it is the case in Tropaeolum, the only member of the Brassicales with floral nectar spurs. The genetic mechanisms underlying both spur and bilateral symmetry in the family have not yet been investigated. METHODS: We studied flower development and morphoanatomy of Tropaeolum longifolium. We also generated a reference transcriptome and isolated all candidate genes involved in adaxial-abaxial differential growth during spur formation. Finally, we evaluated the evolution of the targeted genes across Brassicales and examined their expression in dissected floral parts. RESULTS: Five sepals initiate spirally, followed by five petals alternate to the sepals, five antesepalous stamens, three antepetalous stamens, and three carpels. Intercalary growth at the common base of sepals and petals forms a floral tube. The spur is an outgrowth from the adaxial region of the tube, lined up with the medial sepal. We identified Tropaeolum specific duplications in the TCP3/4L and STM gene lineages, which are critical for spur formation in other taxa. In addition, we found that TM6 (MADS-box), RL2 (RAD-like7), and KN2/6L2 and OSH6L (KNOX1 genes), have been lost in core Brassicales but retained in Tropaeolum. CONCLUSIONS: Three genes are pivotal during the extreme adaxial-abaxial asymmetry of the floral tube, namely, TlTCP4L2 restricted to the adaxial side where the spur is formed, and TlTCP12 and TlSTM1 to the abaxial side, lacking a spur.

AB  - Based on their evolutionary origin, MADS box transcription factor genes have been divided into two classes, namely, type I and II. The plant-specific type II MIKC MADS box genes have been most intensively studied and shown to be key regulators of developmental processes, such as meristem identity, flowering time, and fruit and seed development. By contrast, very little is known about type I MADS domain transcription factors, and they have not attracted interest for a long time. A number of recent studies have now indicated a key regulatory role for type I MADS box factors in plant reproduction, in particular in specifying female gametophyte, embryo, and endosperm development. These analyses have also suggested that type I MADS box factors are decisive for setting reproductive boundaries between species.

AB  - Y chromosomes carry genes with functions in male reproduction and often have few other loci. Their evolution and the causes of genetic degeneration are of great interest. In addition to genetic degeneration, the acquisition of autosomal genes may be important in Y chromosome evolution. We here report that the dioecious plant Silene latifolia harbors a complete MADS box gene, SlAP3Y, duplicated onto the Y chromosome. This gene has no X-linked homologs but only an autosomal paralog, SlAP3A, and sequence divergence suggests that the duplication is a quite old event that occurred soon after the evolution of the sex chromosomes. Evolutionary sequence analyses using homologs of closely related species, including hermaphroditic Silene conica and dioecious Silene dioica and Silene diclinis, suggest that both SlAP3A and SlAP3Y genes encode functional proteins. Indeed, quantitative RT-PCR and in situ hybridization analyses showed that SlAP3A is expressed specifically in developing petals, but SlAP3Y is much more strongly expressed in developing stamens. The S. conica homolog, ScAP3A, is expressed in developing petals, suggesting subfunctionalization with evolution of male-specific functions, possibly due to evolutionary change in regulatory elements. Our results suggest that the acquisition of autosomal genes is an important event in the evolution of plant Y chromosomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ripening in tomato is predominantly controlled by ethylene, whilst in fruit such as grape, it is predominantly controlled by other hormones. The ripening response of many kiwifruit (Actinidia) species is atypical. The majority of ripening-associated fruit starch hydrolysis, colour change and softening occurs in the apparent absence of ethylene production (Phase 1 ripening) whilst Phase 2 ripening requires autocatalytic ethylene production and is associated with further softening and an increase in aroma volatiles. RESULTS: To dissect the ripening response in the yellow-fleshed kiwifruit A. chinensis ('Hort16A'), a two dimensional developmental stage X ethylene response time study was undertaken. As fruit progressed through maturation and Phase 1 ripening, fruit were treated with different concentrations of propylene and ethylene. At the start of Phase 1 ripening, treated fruit responded to ethylene, and were capable of producing endogenous ethylene. As the fruit progressed through Phase 1 ripening, the fruit became less responsive to ethylene and endogeneous ethylene production was partially repressed. Towards the end of Phase 1 ripening the fruit were again able to produce high levels of ethylene. Progression through Phase 1 ripening coincided with a developmental increase in the expression of the ethylene-unresponsive MADS-box FRUITFUL-like gene (FUL1). The ability to respond to ethylene however coincided with a change in expression of another MADS-box gene SEPALLATA4/RIPENING INHIBITOR-like (SEP4/RIN). The promoter of SEP4/RIN was shown to be transactivated by EIN3-like transcription factors, but unlike tomato, not by SEP4/RIN itself. Transient over-expression of SEP4/RIN in kiwifruit caused an increase in ethylene production. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the non-ethylene/ethylene ripening response observed in kiwifruit is a hybrid of both the tomato and grape ripening progression, with Phase 1 being akin to the RIN/ethylene inhibitory response observed in grape and Phase 2 akin to the RIN-associated autocatalytic ethylene response observed in tomato.

AB  - Seed size is one of the major determinants of seed weight and eventually, crop yield. As the global population is increasing beyond the capacity of current food production, enhancing seed size is a key target for crop breeders. Despite the identification of several genes and QTLs, current understanding about the molecular regulation of seed size/weight remains fragmentary. In the present study, we report novel role of a jasmonic acid (JA) signaling repressor, OsJAZ11 controlling rice seed width and weight. Transgenic rice lines overexpressing OsJAZ11 exhibited up to a 14% increase in seed width and ~30% increase in seed weight compared to wild type (WT). Constitutive expression of OsJAZ11 dramatically influenced spikelet morphogenesis leading to extra glume-like structures, open hull, and abnormal numbers of floral organs. Furthermore, overexpression lines accumulated higher JA levels in spikelets and developing seeds. Expression studies uncovered altered expression of JA biosynthesis/signaling and MADS box genes in overexpression lines compared to WT. Yeast two-hybrid and pull-down assays revealed that OsJAZ11 interacts with OsMADS29 and OsMADS68. Remarkably, expression of OsGW7, a key negative regulator of grain size, was significantly reduced in overexpression lines. We propose that OsJAZ11 participates in the regulation of seed size and spikelet development by coordinating the expression of JA-related, OsGW7 and MADS genes.

AB  - Studies on distantly related dicot plant species have identified homeotic genes that specify floral meristem identity and determine the fate of floral organ primordia. Most of these genes belong to a family characterized by the presence of a structural motif, the MADS-box, which encodes a protein domain with DNA-binding properties. As part of an effort to understand how such genes may have been recruited during the evolution of flowers with different organ types such as those found in maize, two members of this gene family in maize, ZAG1 and ZAG2, have been characterized previously. Here, the isolation and characterization of four new members of this gene family, designated ZAP1, ZAG3, ZAG4 and ZAG5, are described and the genetic map position of these and 28 additional maize MADS-box genes is determined. The first new member of this family appears to be the Zea mays ortholog of the floral homeotic gene APETALA1 (AP1) and has been designated ZAP1. One of these genes, ZAG4, is unusual in that its deduced protein sequence includes the MADS domain but lacks the K-domain characteristically present in this family of genes. In addition, its copy number and expression varies among different inbreds. A large number of maize MADS-box genes map to duplicated regions of the genome, including one pair characterized here, ZAG3 and ZAG5. These data underscore the complexity of this gene family in maize, and provide the basis for further studies into the regulation of floral organ morphogenesis among the grasses.

AB  - The timing of flowering initiation is a fundamental trait for the adaptation of annual plants to different environments. Large amounts of intraspecific quantitative variation have been described for it among natural accessions of many species, but the molecular and evolutionary mechanisms underlying this genetic variation are mainly being determined in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. To find novel A. thaliana flowering QTL, we developed introgression lines from the Japanese accession Fuk, which was selected based on the substantial transgression observed in an F(2) population with the reference strain Ler. Analysis of an early flowering line carrying a single Fuk introgression identified Flowering Arabidopsis QTL1 (FAQ1). We fine-mapped FAQ1 in an 11 kb genomic region containing the MADS transcription factor gene SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP). Complementation of the early flowering phenotype of FAQ1-Fuk with a SVP-Ler transgen demonstrated that FAQ1 is SVP. We further proved by directed mutagenesis and transgenesis that a single amino acid substitution in SVP causes the loss-of-function and early flowering of Fuk allele. Analysis of a worldwide collection of accessions detected FAQ1/SVP-Fuk allele only in Asia, with the highest frequency appearing in Japan, where we could also detect a potential ancestral genotype of FAQ1/SVP-Fuk. In addition, we evaluated allelic and epistatic interactions of SVP natural alleles by analysing more than one hundred transgenic lines carrying Ler or Fuk SVP alleles in five genetic backgrounds. Quantitative analyses of these lines showed that FAQ1/SVP effects vary from large to small depending on the genetic background. These results support that the flowering repressor SVP has been recently selected in A. thaliana as a target for early flowering, and evidence the relevance of genetic interactions for the intraspecific evolution of FAQ1/SVP and flowering time.

AB  - MADS-box transcription factors widely regulate all aspects of plant growth including development and reproduction. Although the MADS-box gene family genes have been extensively characterized in many plants, they have not been studied in closely related species. In this study, 73 and 74 MADS-box genes were identified in European pear (Pyrus communis) and Chinese pear (Pyrus bretschneideri), respectively. Based on the phylogenetic relationship, these genes could be clustered into five groups (Malpha, Mbeta, Mr, MIKC(C), MIKC*) and the MIKC(C) group was further categorized into 10 subfamilies. The distribution of MADS-box genes on each chromosome was significantly nonrandom. Thirty-seven orthologs, twenty-five PcpMADS (P. communis MADS-box) paralogs and nineteen PbrMADS (P. bretschneideri MADS-box) paralogs were predicted. Among these paralogous genes, two pairs arose from tandem duplications (TD), nineteen from segmental duplication (SD) events and twenty-three from whole genome duplication (WGD) events, indicating SD/WGD events led to the expansion of MADS-box gene family. The MADS-box genes expression profiles in pear fruits indicated functional divergence and neo-functionalization or sub-functionalization of some orthologous genes originated from a common ancestor. This study provided a useful reference for further analysis the mechanisms of species differentiation and biodiversity formation among closely related species.

AB  - MADS-box transcription factors play crucial roles in regulating development processes and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites in eukaryotes. However, the role of MADS-box transcription factors vary among fungal species, and their function remains unclear in the medicinally and economically important fungus Ganoderma lucidum. In this study, we characterized a MADS-box gene, GlMADS1, in G. lucidum. Analyses using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) showed that GlMADS1 expression levels were up-regulated from the mycelia to the primordia stage. In order to further evaluate the effect of MADS-box transcription factors on secondary metabolism, we utilized RNA interference (RNAi) to silence GlMADS1 in G. lucidum. Ganoderic acid (GA) and flavonoid contents were enhanced in GlMADS1-silenced strains, suggesting that GlMADS1 negatively regulates GA and flavonoid accumulation.

AB  - IiSVP of Isatis indigotica was cloned and its expression pattern was analyzed. Ectopic expression of IiSVP in Arabidopsis could delay the flowering time and reduce the size of the floral organs. SVP (SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE) can negatively regulate the flowering time of Arabidopsis. In the present work, the cDNA of IiSVP, an orthologous gene of AtSVP in I. indigotica, was cloned. IiSVP was highly expressed in rosette leaves, inflorescences and petals, but weakly expressed in sepals, pistils and young silicles. The results of subcellular localization showed that IiSVP was localized in nucleus. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that this protein was a MADS-box transcription factor. Constitutive expression of IiSVP in Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in decrease of the number of petals and stamens, and curly sepals were formed. In IiSVP transgenic Arabidopsis plants, obvious phenotypic variations in flowers could be observed, especially the size of the floral organs. In comparison with the wild-type plants, the size of petals, stamens and pistil in IiSVP transgenic Arabidopsis plants was decreased significantly. In some transgenic plants, the petals were wrapped by the sepals. Yeast two-hybrid experiments showed that IiSVP could form higher-order complexes with other MADS proteins, including IiSEP1, IiSEP3, IiAP1 and IiSEP4, but could not interact with IiSEP2. In this work, it was proved that the flowering process and the floral development in Arabidopsis could be affected by IiSVP from I. indigotica Fortune.

AB  - To understand the molecular mechanisms involved in the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth, the photoperiodic-controlled induction of flowering in the long-day plant Sinapis alba was used to screen for regulatory genes which are expressed upon induction in the apical meristem. By using the conserved MADS box-encoding region of the organ identity gene AGAMOUS, the genes SaMADS A and SaMADS B were identified which are expressed in transition stages of mustard. RNA blot analysis has confirmed that the transcript levels of both genes are drastically increased shortly after the induction of flowering and that both genes are expressed earlier than the known MADS box genes. In situ hybridization studies have shown that the expression of the genes is restricted to the apical meristem of induced plants during early phases of reproductive development. The expression of SaMADS A is first detectable in the central zone of the meristem, a region where the earliest changes of an evoked meristem could be detected by classical physiological methods, suggesting that SaMADS A may have an important function during the transition to flowering.

AB  - Bletilla striata (Thunb. ex A. Murray) Rchb. f., a species of the perennial herb Orchidaceae, has potent anti-inflammatory and antiviral biological activities. MADS-box transcription factors play critical roles in the various developmental processes of plants. Although this gene family has been extensively investigated in many species, it has not been analyzed for B. striata. In total, 45 MADS-box genes were identified from B. striata in this study, which were classified into five subfamilies (Mdelta, MIKC, Malpha, Mbeta, and Mgamma). Meanwhile, the highly correlated protein domains, motif compositions, and exon-intron structures of BsMADSs were investigated according to local B. striata databases. Chromosome distribution and synteny analyses revealed that segmental duplication and homologous exchange were the main BsMADSs expansion mechanisms. Further, RT-qPCR analysis revealed that BsMADSs had different expression patterns in response to various stress treatments.

AB  - Apple (Malus × domestica Borkh.) is a perennial woody plant that undergoes a period of dormancy (in cv. Jonathan between late September and mid-December) to survive freezing temperatures of winter. DORMANCY-ASSOCIATED MADS-BOX (DAM) genes play important roles in the regulation of growth cessation and terminal bud formation in peach. To understand the role of DAM orthologs in apple, we isolated and characterized four DAM-like genes (designated as MdDAMa, MdDAMb, MdDAMc, and MdDAMd) and monitored their expression in apical buds throughout the season by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses. The transcription of MdDAMa peaked in October and that of MdDAMc was elevated from August to October, whereas MdDAMb and MdDAMd were practically undetectable. The tandemly arranged genes MdDAMa/MdDAMb and MdDAMc/MdDAMd were localized to chromosomes 16 and 8, respectively. Based on these observations, we infer that MdDAMa and MdDAMc acted in a dominant fashion on each locus and were correlated with the period of endodormancy.

AB  - Jatropha curcas L. is monoecious with a low female-to-male ratio, which is one of the factors restricting its seed yield. Because the phytohormone cytokinins play an essential role in flower development, particularly pistil development, in this study, we elevated the cytokinin levels in J. curcas flowers through transgenic expression of a cytokinin biosynthetic gene (AtIPT4) from Arabidopsis under the control of a J. curcas orthologue of TOMATO MADS BOX GENE 6 (JcTM6) promoter that is predominantly active in flowers. As expected, the levels of six cytokinin species in the inflorescences were elevated, and flower development was modified without any alterations in vegetative growth. In the transgenic J. curcas plants, the flower number per inflorescence was significantly increased, and most flowers were pistil-predominantly bisexual, i.e., the flowers had a huge pistil surrounded with small stamens. Unfortunately, both the male and the bisexual flowers of transgenic J. curcas were infertile, which might have resulted from the continuously high expression of the transgene during flower development. However, the number and position of floral organs in the transgenic flowers were well defined, which suggested that the determinacy of the floral meristem was not affected. These results suggest that fine-tuning the endogenous cytokinins can increase the flower number and the female-to-male ratio in J. curcas.

AB  - The haploid generation of flowering plants develops within the sporophytic tissues of the ovule. After fertilization, the maternal seed coat develops in a coordinated manner with formation of the embryo and endosperm. In the arabidopsis bsister (abs) mutant, the endothelium, which is the most inner cell layer of the integuments that surround the haploid embryo sac, does not accumulate proanthocyanidins and the cells have an abnormal morphology. However, fertility is not affected in abs single mutants. SEEDSTICK regulates ovule identity redundantly with SHATTERPROOF 1 (SHP1) and SHP2 while a role in the control of fertility was not reported previously. Here we describe the characterization of the abs stk double mutant. This double mutant develops very few seeds due to both a reduced number of fertilized ovules and seed abortions later during development. Morphological analysis revealed a total absence of endothelium in this double mutant. Additionally, massive starch accumulation was observed in the embryo sac. The phenotype of the abs stk double mutant highlights the importance of the maternal-derived tissues, particularly the endothelium, for the development of the next generation.

AB  - The SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) gene is a transcription factor that integrates flowering signals and plays an important role in the regulation of flowering time in many plants. In this study, two full-length cDNA sequences of SVP homologous genes-MiSVP1 and MiSVP2-were obtained from 'SiJiMi' mango. Sequence analysis showed that the MiSVPs had typical MADS-box domains and were highly conserved between each other. The analysis of expression patterns showed that the MiSVPs were expressed during flower development and highly expressed in vegetative tissues, with low expression in flowers/buds. The MiSVPs could responded to low temperature, NaCl, and PEG treatment. Subcellular localization revealed that MiSVP1 and MiSVP2 were localized in the nucleus. Transformation of Arabidopsis revealed that overexpression of MiSVP1 delayed flowering time, overexpression of MiSVP2 accelerated flowering time, and neither MiSVP1 nor MiSVP2 had an effect on the number of rosette leaves. Overexpression of MiSVP1 increased the expression of AtFLC and decreased the expression of AtFT and AtSOC1, and overexpression of MiSVP2 increased the expression levels of AtSOC1 and AtFT and decreased the expression levels of AtFLC. Point-to-point and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays showed that MiSVP1 and MiSVP2 could interact with SEP1-1, SOC1D, and AP1-2. These results suggest that MiSVP1 and MiSVP2 may play a significant roles in the flowering process of mango.

AB  - Rice has the natural morphological adaptation to germinate and elongate its coleoptile under submerged flooding conditions. The phenotypic deviation associated with the tolerance to submergence at the germination stage could be due to natural variation. However, the molecular basis of this variation is still largely unknown. A comprehensive understanding of gene regulation of different genotypes that have diverse rates of coleoptile elongation can provide significant insights into improved rice varieties. To do so, publicly available transcriptome data of five rice genotypes, which have different lengths of coleoptile elongation under submergence tolerance, were analyzed. The aim was to identify the correlation between promoter architecture, associated with transcriptional and hormonal regulation, in diverse genotype groups of rice that have different rates of coleoptile elongation. This was achieved by identifying the putative cis-elements present in the promoter sequences of genes upregulated in each group of genotypes (tolerant, highly tolerant, and extremely tolerant genotypes). Promoter analysis identified transcription factors (TFs) that are common and unique to each group of genotypes. The candidate TFs that are common in all genotypes are MYB, bZIP, AP2/ERF, ARF, WRKY, ZnF, MADS-box, NAC, AS2, DOF, E2F, ARR-B, and HSF. However, the highly tolerant genotypes interestingly possess binding sites associated with HY5 (bZIP), GBF3, GBF4 and GBF5 (bZIP), DPBF-3 (bZIP), ABF2, ABI5, bHLH, and BES/BZR, in addition to the common TFs. Besides, the extremely tolerant genotypes possess binding sites associated with bHLH TFs such as BEE2, BIM1, BIM3, BM8 and BAM8, and ABF1, in addition to the TFs identified in the tolerant and highly tolerant genotypes. The transcriptional regulation of these TFs could be linked to phenotypic variation in coleoptile elongation in response to submergence tolerance. Moreover, the results indicate a cross-talk between the key TFs and phytohormones such as gibberellic acid, abscisic acid, ethylene, auxin, jasmonic acid, and brassinosteroids, for an altered transcriptional regulation leading to differences in germination and coleoptile elongation under submergence. The information derived from the current in silico analysis can potentially assist in developing new rice breeding targets for direct seeding.

AB  - Fruit set is the earliest phase of fruit growth and represents the onset of ovary growth after successful fertilization. In parthenocarpy, fruit formation is less affected by environmental factors because it occurs in the absence of pollination and fertilization, making parthenocarpy a highly desired agronomic trait. Elucidating the genetic program controlling parthenocarpy, and more generally fruit set, may have important implications in agriculture, considering the need for crops to be adaptable to climate changes. Several phytohormones play an important role in the transition from flower to fruit. Further complexity emerges from functional analysis of floral homeotic genes. Some homeotic MADS-box genes are implicated in fruit growth and development, displaying an expression pattern commonly observed for ovary growth repressors. Here, we provide an overview of recent discoveries on the molecular regulatory gene network underlying fruit set in tomato, the model organism for fleshy fruit development due to the many genetic and genomic resources available. We describe how the genetic modification of components of this network can cause parthenocarpy, discussing the contribution of hormonal signals and MADS-box transcription factors.

AB  - The diverse morphology of orchid flowers and their complex, often deceptive strategies to become pollinated have fascinated researchers for a long time. However, it was not until the 20th century that the ontogeny of orchid (orchids) flowers, the genetic basis of their morphology and the complex phylogeny of Orchidaceae were investigated. In parallel, the improvement of techniques for in vitro seed germination and tissue culture, together with studies on biochemistry, physiology, and cytology supported the progress of what is now a highly productive industry of orchid breeding and propagation. In the present century both basic research in orchid flower evo-devo and the interest for generating novel horticultural varieties have driven the characterization of many members of the MADS-box family encoding key regulators of flower development. This perspective summarizes the picture emerging from these studies and discusses the advantages and limitations of the comparative strategy employed so far. I address the growing role of natural and horticultural mutants in these studies and the emergence of several model species in orchid evo-devo and genomics. In this context, I make a plea for an increasingly integrative approach.

AB  - In flowering plants, class-B floral homeotic genes encode MADS-domain transcription factors, which are key in the specification of petal and stamen identity, and have two ancient clades: DEF-like and GLO-like genes. Many species have one gene of each clade, but orchids have typically four DEF-like genes, representing ancient gene clades 1, 2, 3 and 4. We tested the 'orchid code', a combinatorial genetic model suggesting that differences between the organs of the orchid perianth (outer tepals, inner lateral tepals and labellum) are generated by the combinatorial differential expression of four DEF-like genes. Our experimental test involves highly sensitive and specific measurements, with qRT-PCR of the expression of DEF- and GLO-like genes from the distantly related Vanilla planifolia and Phragmipedium longifolium, as well as from wild-type and peloric Phalaenopsis hybrid flowers. Our findings support the first 'orchid code' hypothesis, in that absence of clade-3 and -4 gene expression distinguishes the outer tepals from the inner tepals. In contrast to the original hypothesis, however, mRNA of both clade-3 and -4 genes accumulates in wild-type inner lateral tepals and the labellum, and in labellum-like inner lateral tepals of peloric flowers, albeit in different quantities. Our data suggest a revised hypothesis where high levels of clade-1 and -2, and low levels of clade-3 and -4, gene expression specify inner lateral tepals, whereas labellum development requires low levels of clade-1 and -2 expression and high levels of clade-3 and -4 expression.

AB  - In Catharanthus roseus, monomeric terpenoid indole alkaloids (TIAs) are biosynthesized in specific tissues, particularly in roots, but failed to be produced by in vitro undifferentiated suspension cells. In this paper, we describe the impact of the root-specific MADS-box transcription factor Agamous-like 12 (Agl12) from Arabidopsis thaliana on the differentiation of suspension cells from C. roseus. The expression of Agl12 is sufficient to promote an organization of suspension cells into globular parenchyma-like aggregates but is insufficient by itself to induce complete morphological root differentiation. Agl12 expression selectively increases the expression of genes encoding enzymes involved in the early biosynthesis steps of the terpenic precursor of alkaloids. The transgenic cell lines expressing Agl12 produced significant amounts of ajmalicine, an antihypertensive TIA that normally accumulates in C. roseus roots. The present paper indicates that transcription factors involved in tissue or organ differentiation may constitute new metabolic engineering tools that could help to design in vitro cultured cells able to produce specific valuable secondary metabolites.

AB  - Until recently, the roles of plant MADS-box genes have mainly been characterized during inflorescence and flower differentiation. In order to precise the roles of AGAMOUS-LIKE 12, one of the few MADS-box genes preferentially expressed in roots, we placed its cDNA under the control of the double 35S CaMV promoter to produce transgenic walnut tree and Arabidopsis plants. In Juglans sp., transgenic somatic embryos showed significantly higher germination rates but abnormal development of their shoot apex prevented their conversion into plants. In addition, a wide range of developmental abnormalities corresponding to ectopic root-like structures affected the transgenic lines suggesting partial reorientations of the embryonic program toward root differentiation. In Arabidopsis, AtAGL12 overexpression lead to the production of faster growing plants presenting dramatically wider and shorter root phenotypes linked to increased meristematic cell numbers within the root apex. In the upper part of the roots, abnormal cell divisions patterns within the pericycle layer generated large ectopic cell masses that did not prevent plants to grow. Taken together, our results confirm in both species that AGL12 positively regulates root meristem cell division and promotes overall root vascular tissue formation. Genetic engineering of AGL12 expression levels could be useful to modulate root architecture and development.

AB  - The floral transition in Arabidopsis is regulated by at least four flowering pathways: the long-day, autonomous, vernalization, and gibberellin (GA)-dependent pathways. Previously, we reported that the MADS-box transcription factor SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CO 1 (SOC1) integrates the long-day and vernalization/autonomous pathways. Here, we present evidences that SOC1 also integrates signaling from the GA-dependent pathway, a major flowering pathway under non-inductive short days. Under short days, the flowering time of GA-biosynthetic and -signaling mutants was well correlated with the level of SOC1 expression; overexpression of SOC1 rescued the non-flowering phenotype of ga1-3, and the soc1 null mutant showed reduced sensitivity to GA for flowering. In addition, we show that vernalization-induced repression of FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), an upstream negative regulator of SOC1, is not sufficient to activate SOC1; positive factors are also required. Under short days, the GA pathway provides a positive factor for SOC1 activation. In contrast to SOC1, the GA pathway does not regulate expression of other flowering integrators FLC and FT. Our results explain why the GA pathway has a strong effect on flowering under short days and how vernalization and GA interact at the molecular level.

AB  - Functional redundancy between duplicated genes is predicted to be transitory, as one gene either loses its function or gains a new function, or both genes accrue degenerative, yet complimentary mutations. Yet there are many examples where functional redundancy has been maintained between gene duplicates. To determine whether selection is acting on functionally redundant gene duplicates, we performed molecular evolution and population genetic analyses between two pairs of functionally redundant MADS-box genes from the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana: SEPALLATA1 (SEP1) and SEPALLATA2 (SEP2), involved in floral organ identity, and SHATTERPROOF1 (SHP1) and SHATTERPROOF2 (SHP2), involved in seed shattering. We found evidence for purifying selection acting to constrain functional divergence between paralogous genes. The protein evolution of both pairs of duplicate genes is functionally constrained, as evidenced by Ka/Ks ratios of 0.16 between paralogs. This functional constraint is stronger in the highly conserved DNA-binding and protein-binding MIK region than in the C-terminal region. We also assayed the evolutionary forces acting between orthologs of the SEP and SHP genes in A. thaliana and the closely related species, Arabidopsis lyrata. Heterogeneity analyses of the polymorphism-to-divergence ratio indicate selective sweeps have occurred within the transcriptional unit of SHP1 and the promoter of SHP2 in the A. thaliana lineage. Similar analyses identified a significant reduction in polymorphism within the SEP1 locus, spanning the 3' region of intron 1 to exon 3, that may represent an intragenic sweep within the SEP1 locus. We discuss whether the evolutionary forces acting on SEP1 and SEP2 versus SHP1 and SHP2 vary according to their position in the floral developmental pathway, as found with other floral-regulatory genes.

AB  - Members of SEPALLATA (SEP) and APETALA1 (AP1)/SQUAMOSA (SQUA) MADS-box transcription factor subfamilies play key roles in floral organ identity determination and floral meristem determinacy in the rosid species Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Here, we present a functional characterization of the seven SEP/AGL6 and four AP1/SQUA genes in the distant asterid species petunia (Petunia x hybrida). Based on the analysis of single and higher order mutants, we report that the petunia SEP1/SEP2/SEP3 orthologs together with AGL6 encode classical SEP floral organ identity and floral termination functions, with a master role for the petunia SEP3 ortholog FLORAL BINDING PROTEIN2 (FBP2). By contrast, the FBP9 subclade members FBP9 and FBP23, for which no clear ortholog is present in Arabidopsis, play a major role in determining floral meristem identity together with FBP4, while contributing only moderately to floral organ identity. In turn, the four members of the petunia AP1/SQUA subfamily redundantly are required for inflorescence meristem identity and act as B-function repressors in the first floral whorl, together with BEN/ROB genes. Overall, these data together with studies in other species suggest major differences in the functional diversification of the SEP/AGL6 and AP1/SQUA MADS-box subfamilies during angiosperm evolution.plantcell;31/12/3033/FX1F1fx1.

AB  - Nymphaeaceae are early diverging angiosperms with large flowers characterized by showy petals and stamens not clearly whorled but presenting a gradual morphological transition from the outer elements to the inner stamens. Such flower structure makes these plant species relevant for studying flower evolution. MADS-domain transcription factors are crucial components of the molecular network that controls flower development. We therefore isolated and characterized MADS-box genes from the water lily Nymphaea caerulea. RNA-seq experiments on floral buds have been performed to obtain the transcript sequences of floral organ identity MADS-box genes. Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic analyses confirmed their belonging to specific MADS-box gene subfamilies. Their expression was quantified by RT-qPCR in all floral organs at two stages of development. Protein interactions among these transcription factors were investigated by yeast-two-hybrid assays. We found especially interesting the involvement of two different AGAMOUS-like genes (NycAG1 and NycAG2) in the water lily floral components. They were therefore functionally characterized by complementing Arabidopsis ag and shp1 shp2 mutants. The expression analysis of MADS-box genes across flower development in N. caerulea described a complex scenario made of numerous genes in numerous floral components. Their expression profiles in some cases were in line with what was expected from the ABC model of flower development and its extensions, while in other cases presented new and interesting gene expression patterns, as for instance the involvement of NycAGL6 and NycFL. Although sharing a high level of sequence similarity, the two AGAMOUS-like genes NycAG1 and NycAG2 could have undergone subfunctionalization or neofunctionalization, as only one of them could partially restore the euAG function in Arabidopsis ag-3 mutants. The hereby illustrated N. caerulea MADS-box gene expression pattern might mirror the morphological transition from the outer to the inner floral organs, and the presence of transition organs such as the petaloid stamens. This study is intended to broaden knowledge on the role and evolution of floral organ identity genes and the genetic mechanisms causing biodiversity in angiosperm flowers.

AB  - Apple trees require a long exposure to chilling temperature during winter to acquire competency to flower and grow in the following spring. Climate change or adverse meteorological conditions can impair release of dormancy and delay bud break, hence jeopardizing fruit production and causing substantial economic losses. In order to characterize the molecular mechanisms controlling bud dormancy in apple we focused our work on the MADS-box transcription factor gene MdDAM1. We show that MdDAM1 silencing is required for the release of dormancy and bud break in spring. MdDAM1 transcript levels are drastically reduced in the low-chill varieties 'Anna' and 'Dorsett Golden' compared to 'Golden Delicious' corroborating its role as a key genetic factor controlling the release of bud dormancy in Malus species. The functional characterization of MdDAM1 using RNA silencing resulted in trees unable to cease growth in winter and that displayed an evergrowing, or evergreen, phenotype several years after transgenesis. These trees lost their capacity to enter in dormancy and produced leaves and shoots regardless of the season. A transcriptome study revealed that apple evergrowing lines are a genocopy of 'Golden Delicious' trees at the onset of the bud break with the significant gene repression of the related MADS-box gene MdDAM4 as a major feature. We provide the first functional evidence that MADS-box transcriptional factors are key regulators of bud dormancy in pome fruit trees and demonstrate that their silencing results in a defect of growth cessation in autumn. Our findings will help producing low-chill apple variants from the elite commercial cultivars that will withstand climate change.

AB  - Flowering is a critical stage in plant life history, which is coordinated by environmental signals and endogenous cues. Phytomelatonin is a widely distributed indoleamine present in all living organisms and plays pleiotropic roles in plant growth and development. Recent evidence has established that phytomelatonin could modulate flowering in many species, probably in a concentration-dependent manner. Phytomelatonin seems to associate with floral meristem identification and floral organ formation, and the fluctuation of phytomelatonin might be important for flowering. Regarding the underlying mechanisms, phytomelatonin interacts with the central components of floral gene regulatory networks directly or indirectly, including the MADS-box gene family, phytohormones, and reactive oxygen species (ROS). From an evolutionary point of view, the actions of phytomelatonin in flowering probably evolved during the period of the diversification of flowering plants and could be regarded as a functional extension of its primary activities. The presumed evolutionary history of phytomelatonin-modulated flowering is proposed, presented in the chronological order of the appearance of phytomelatonin and core flowering regulators, namely DELLA proteins, ROS, and phytohormones. Further efforts are needed to address some intriguing aspects, such as the exploration of the association between phytomelatonin and photoperiodic flowering, phytomelatonin-related floral MADS-box genes, the crosstalk between phytomelatonin and phytohormones, as well as its potential applications in agriculture.

AB  - DEFH28 is a novel MADS-box gene from Antirrhinum majus. Phylogenetic reconstruction indicates that it belongs to the SQUA-subfamily of MADS-box genes. Based on its expression pattern and the phenotype of transgenic plants it is predicted that DEFH28 exerts a dual function during flower development, namely control of meristem identity and fruit development. Firstly, DEFH28 is expressed in the inflorescence apical meristem and might control, together with SQUAMOSA (SQUA), floral meristem identity in Antirrhinum. Also, DEFH28 is sufficient to switch inflorescence shoot meristem to a floral fate in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants. Secondly, DEFH28 is expressed in carpel walls, where it may regulate carpel wall differentiation and fruit maturation. Support for this later role comes from overexpression of DEFH28 throughout the silique in transgenic Arabidopsis plants where it altered the identity of the replum and valve margin cells so that they adopted a valve cell identity. This late aspect of the DEFH28 function is identical to the FRUITFULL (FUL) function of Arabidopsis as demonstrated in gain-of-function plants. FUL, like DEFH28, belongs to the SQUA-subfamily of MADS-box genes. DEFH28 most likely represents the ortholog of FUL. Promoter analysis shows that the control mechanism conferring a carpel wall specific expression has been conserved between Antirrhinum and Arabidopsis during evolution. Although the overall flower development between Antirrhinum and Arabidopsis is very similar, their carpels mature into different types of fruits: capsules and siliques, respectively. Therefore, it is suggested that the role of DEFH28 in control of carpel wall differentiation reflects a conserved molecular mechanism integrated into two very different carpel developmental pathways.

AB  - Polycomb group (PcG) protein-mediated histone methylation (H3K27me3) controls the correct spatiotemporal expression of numerous developmental regulators in Arabidopsis. Epigenetic silencing of the stem cell factor gene WUSCHEL (WUS) in floral meristems (FMs) depends on H3K27me3 deposition by PcG proteins. However, the role of H3K27me3 in silencing of other meristematic regulator and pluripotency genes during FM determinacy has not yet been studied. To this end, we report the genome-wide dynamics of H3K27me3 levels during FM arrest and the consequences of strongly depleted PcG activity on early flower morphogenesis including enlarged and indeterminate FMs. Strong depletion of H3K27me3 levels results in misexpression of the FM identity gene AGL24, which partially causes floral reversion leading to ap1-like flowers and indeterminate FMs ectopically expressing WUS and SHOOT MERISTEMLESS (STM). Loss of STM can rescue supernumerary floral organs and FM indeterminacy in H3K27me3-deficient flowers, indicating that the hyperactivity of the FMs is at least partially a result of ectopic STM expression. Nonetheless, WUS remained essential for the FM activity. Our results demonstrate that PcG proteins promote FM determinacy at multiple levels of the floral gene regulatory network, silencing initially floral regulators such as AGL24 that promotes FM indeterminacy and, subsequently, meristematic pluripotency genes such as WUS and STM during FM arrest.

AB  - The diploid woodland strawberry (F. vesca) represents an important model for the genus Fragaria. Significant advances in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating seasonal alternance of flower induction and vegetative reproduction has been made in this species. However, this research area has received little attention on the cultivated octoploid strawberry (F. x ananassa) despite its enormous agronomical and economic importance. To advance in the characterization of this intricated molecular network, expression analysis of key flowering time genes was performed both in short and long days and in cultivars with seasonal and perpetual flowering. Analysis of overexpression of FaCO and FaSOC1 in the seasonal flowering 'Camarosa' allowed functional validation of a number of responses already observed in F. vesca while uncovered differences related to the regulation of FaFTs expression and gibberellins (GAs) biosynthesis. While FvCO has been shown to promote flowering and inhibit runner development in the perpetual flowering H4 accession of F. vesca, our study showed that FaCO responds to LD photoperiods as in F. vesca but delayed flowering to some extent, possibly by induction of the strong FaTFL1 repressor in crowns. A contrasting effect on runnering was observed in FaCO transgenic plants, some lines showing reduced runner number whereas in others runnering was slightly accelerated. We demonstrate that the role of the MADS-box transcription factor FaSOC1 as a strong repressor of flowering and promoter of vegetative growth is conserved in woodland and cultivated strawberry. Our study further indicates an important role of FaSOC1 in the photoperiodic repression of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) genes FaFT2 and FaFT3 while FaTFL1 upregulation was less prominent than that observed in F. vesca. In our experimental conditions, FaSOC1 promotion of vegetative growth do not require induction of GA biosynthesis, despite GA biosynthesis genes showed a marked photoperiodic upregulation in response to long days, supporting GA requirement for the promotion of vegetative growth. Our results also provided insights into additional factors, such as FaTEM, associated with the vegetative developmental phase that deserve further characterization in the future.

AB  - Flowers sensu lato are short, specialized axes bearing closely aggregated sporophylls. They are typical for seed plants (spermatophytes) and are prominent in flowering plants sensu stricto (angiosperms), where they often comprise an attractive perianth. There is evidence that spermatophytes evolved from gymnosperm-like plants with a fern-like mode of reproduction called progymnosperms. It seems plausible, therefore, that the stamens/carpels and pollen sacs/nucelli of spermatophytes are homologous to fern sporophylls and sporangia, respectively. However, the exact mode and molecular basis of early seed and flower evolution is not yet known. Comparing flower developmental control genes to their homologs from lower plants that do not flower may help to clarify the issue. We have isolated and characterized MADS-box genes expressed in gametophytes and sporophytes of the fern Ceratopteris. The data indicate that at least two different MADS-box genes homologous to floral homeotic genes existed in the last common ancestor of contemporary vascular plants, some descendants of which underwent multiple duplications and diversifications and were recruited into novel developmental networks during the evolution of floral organs.

AB  - Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with degenerate primers was utilized for partial cloning of the MADS box gene family from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). PCR products corresponding to a part of the MADS box region were cloned and sequenced. Eleven individual clones sequenced were classified into seven types on the basis of the nucleotide sequence and five types on the deduced amino acid sequence, which included two wheat-specific MADS box protein sequences. RT-PCR analysis with degenerate primers revealed preferential expression of the MADS box genes in young spikes. Furthermore, genomic Southern blot analysis with degenerate PCR products as probes indicated that wheat MADS box genes constitute a multigene family and are dispersed throughout the genome.

AB  - Crop molecular breeding primarily focuses on increasing the trait of plant yield. An elongator-associated protein, KTI12, is closely associated with plant biomass and yield. KTI12 is involved in developmental processes of most organs, including the leaf, root, flower, and seed, through regulating cell division and differentiation. Previous work has shown that in upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum), GhKTI12 regulates plant height, flowering, and tolerance to salt and drought stress. However, little is known about the molecular regulation mechanism of GhKTI12 in plant developmental processes. In this study, we identified the main GhKTI12 (Gh_D02G144400) gene and transformed it into tobacco (Nicotonia tabacum cv NC89). From seven transgenic lines, we obtained three (OE5, OE6 and OE8) with high expression of GhKTI12; compared with wild type plants, these three lines exhibited larger plant size, later flowering, and higher seed yield. Microscopic observation revealed that the number of leaf epidermal cells and stem parenchyma cells was increased by ~55%. Biochemical analysis showed that chlorophyll content and starch accumulation were significantly increased in younger leaves at the top canopy of transgenic plants, which may contribute to improved photosynthetic rate and, in turn, increased seed yield. To understand the molecular mechanism of GhKTI12 in transgenic plants development, two lines (OE6 and OE8) with higher expression levels of GhKTI12 were used as representative plants to conduct RNA-seq analysis. Through transcriptome analysis of the plant's shoot apical meristematic tissue of these two lines, we identified 518 upregulated genes and 406 downregulated genes common to both overexpression lines. A large number of cellular component genes associated with cell division and differentiation, such as RD21, TET8, KTN80, AOX1, AOX2, CP1, and KIC, were found to be upregulated, and genes showing the most downregulation included MADS-box genes related to flowering time, such as MADS6, AP1, AP3, AGL8, AGL6, SEP1, and SEP2. Downregulation of these genes caused delayed flowering time and longer vegetative stage during development. Combined with the upregulation of the yield-related gene RD21, the GhKTI12 transgenic plants could produce a higher seed yield. We here show that the overexpression of GhKTI12 could positively improve key agronomic traits in tobacco by regulating cell proliferation, photosynthesis, and organ development, and suggest that homologs of GhKTI12 may also be important in the genetic improvement of other crop plants.

AB  - Pedicel abscission occurs widely in fruit-bearing plants to detach ripe, senescent or diseased organs, and regulation of abscission plays a substantial role in regulating yield and quality in fruit crops. In tomato, development of pedicel abscission zones (AZs) requires the MADS-box genes JOINTLESS (J), MACROCALYX (MC) and SlMBP21. In other plants, however, the involvement of MADS-box genes in pedicel abscission remains unclear. Here, we used genetic and biochemical methods to characterize apple J homologs in the context of the regulation of abscission in tomato. We identified three genes encoding two J homologs, MdJa and MdJb. Similarly to J, MdJa and MdJb interacted with MC and SlMBP21, but their interactions differed slightly: like J, MdJb formed a multimer (probably a tetramer) with SlMBP21; however, MdJa formed multimers to a lesser extent. Ectopic expression of MdJb in a J-deficient tomato mutant restored development of functional pedicel AZs, but ectopic expression of MdJa did not complement j mutants. Introduction of MdJb also restored expression of J-dependent genes in the mutant, such as genes for polygalacturonase, cellulase and AZ-specific transcription factors. These results suggest a potentially conserved mechanism of pedicel AZ development in apple and other plants, regulated by MADS-box transcription factors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Generally, double-flowered varieties are more attractive than single-flowered varieties in ornamental plants. Japanese gentian is one of the most popular floricultural plants in Japan, and it is desirable to breed elite double-flowered cultivars. In this study, we attempted to characterize a doubled-flower mutant of Japanese gentian. To identify the gene that causes the double-flowered phenotype in Japanese gentian, we isolated and characterized MADS-box genes. RESULTS: Fourteen MADS-box genes were isolated, and two of them were C-class MADS-box genes (GsAG1 and GsAG2). Both GsAG1 and GsAG2 were categorized into the PLE/SHP subgroup, rather than the AG/FAR subgroup. In expression analyses, GsAG1 transcripts were detected in the second to fourth floral whorls, while GsAG2 transcripts were detected in only the inner two whorls. Transgenic Arabidopsis expressing GsAG1 lacked petals and formed carpeloid organs instead of sepals. Compared with a single-flowered gentian cultivar, a double-flowered gentian mutant showed decreased expression of GsAG1 but unchanged expression of GsAG2. An analysis of the genomic structure of GsAG1 revealed that the gene had nine exons and eight introns, and that a 5,150-bp additional sequence was inserted into the sixth intron of GsAG1 in the double-flowered mutant. This insert had typical features of a Ty3/gypsy-type LTR-retrotransposon, and was designated as Tgs1. Virus-induced gene silencing of GsAG1 by the Apple latent spherical virus vector resulted in the conversion of the stamen to petaloid organs in early flowering transgenic gentian plants expressing an Arabidopsis FT gene. CONCLUSIONS: These results revealed that GsAG1 plays a key role as a C-functional gene in stamen organ identity. The identification of the gene responsible for the double-flowered phenotype will be useful in further research on the floral morphogenesis of Japanese gentian.

AB  - MADS-box genes in plants control various aspects of development and reproductive processes including flower formation. To obtain some insight into the roles of these genes in morphological evolution, we investigated the origin and diversification of floral MADS-box genes by conducting molecular evolutionary genetics analyses. Our results suggest that the most recent common ancestor of today's floral MADS-box genes evolved roughly 650 MYA, much earlier than the Cambrian explosion. They also suggest that the functional classes T (SVP), B (and Bs), C, F (AGL20 or TM3), A, and G (AGL6) of floral MADS-box genes diverged sequentially in this order from the class E gene lineage. The divergence between the class G and E genes apparently occurred around the time of the angiosperm/gymnosperm split. Furthermore, the ancestors of three classes of genes (class T genes, class B/Bs genes, and the common ancestor of the other classes of genes) might have existed at the time of the Cambrian explosion. We also conducted a phylogenetic analysis of MADS-domain sequences from various species of plants and animals and presented a hypothetical scenario of the evolution of MADS-box genes in plants and animals, taking into account paleontological information. Our study supports the idea that there are two main evolutionary lineages (type I and type II) of MADS-box genes in plants and animals.

AB  - Plant MADS-box genes form a large gene family for transcription factors and are involved in various aspects of developmental processes, including flower development. They are known to be subject to birth-and-death evolution, but the detailed features of this mode of evolution remain unclear. To have a deeper insight into the evolutionary pattern of this gene family, we enumerated all available functional and nonfunctional (pseudogene) MADS-box genes from the Arabidopsis and rice genomes. Plant MADS-box genes can be classified into types I and II genes on the basis of phylogenetic analysis. Conducting extensive homology search and phylogenetic analysis, we found 64 presumed functional and 37 nonfunctional type I genes and 43 presumed functional and 4 nonfunctional type II genes in Arabidopsis. We also found 24 presumed functional and 6 nonfunctional type I genes and 47 presumed functional and 1 nonfunctional type II genes in rice. Our phylogenetic analysis indicated there were at least about four to eight type I genes and approximately 15-20 type II genes in the most recent common ancestor of Arabidopsis and rice. It has also been suggested that type I genes have experienced a higher rate of birth-and-death evolution than type II genes in angiosperms. Furthermore, the higher rate of birth-and-death evolution in type I genes appeared partly due to a higher frequency of segmental gene duplication and weaker purifying selection in type I than in type II genes.

AB  - Eukaryotic cells use nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) to clear aberrant mRNAs from the cell, thus preventing the accumulation of truncated proteins. In Arabidopsis, two UP-Frameshift (UPF) proteins, UPF1 and UPF3, play a critical role in NMD. Although deficiency of UPF1 and UPF3 leads to various developmental defects, little is known about the mechanism underlying the regulation of flowering time by NMD. Here, we showed that the upf1-5 and upf3-1 mutants had a late-flowering phenotype under long-day conditions and the upf1-5 upf3-1 double mutants had an additive effect in delaying flowering time. RNA sequencing of the upf mutants revealed that UPF3 exerted a stronger effect than UPF1 in the UPF-mediated regulation of flowering time. Among genes known to regulate flowering time, FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) mRNA levels increased (up to 8-fold) in upf mutants, as confirmed by qPCR. The upf1-5, upf3-1, and upf1-5 upf3-1 mutants responded to vernalization, suggesting a role of FLC in delayed flowering of upf mutants. Consistent with the high FLC transcript levels and delayed flowering in upf mutants, levels of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 (SOC1) mRNAs were reduced in the upf mutants. However, RNA-seq did not identify an aberrant FLC transcript containing a premature termination codon (PTC), suggesting that FLC is not a direct target in the regulation of flowering time by NMD. Among flowering time regulators that act in an FLC-dependent manner, we found that MAF3, NF-YA2, NF-YA5, and TAF14 showed increased transcript levels in upf mutants. We also found that BBX19 and ATC, which act in an FLC-independent manner, showed increased transcript levels in upf mutants. An aberrant transcript containing a PTC was identified from MAF3 and BBX19 and the levels of the aberrant transcripts increased in upf mutants. Taking these results together, we propose that the late-flowering phenotype of upf mutants is mediated by at least two different pathways, namely, by MAF3 in an FLC-dependent manner and by BBX19 in an FLC-independent manner.

AB  - RNA polymerase II-associated factor 1 complex (PAF1C) regulates the transition from the vegetative to the reproductive phase primarily by modulating the expression of FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) and FLOWERING LOCUS M [FLM, also known as MADS AFFECTING FLOWERING1 (MAF1)] at standard growth temperatures. However, the role of PAF1C in the regulation of flowering time at chilling temperatures (i.e., cold temperatures that are above freezing) and whether PAF1C affects other FLC-clade genes (MAF2-MAF5) remains unknown. Here, we showed that Arabidopsis thaliana mutants of any of the six known genes that encode components of PAF1C [CELL DIVISION CYCLE73/PLANT HOMOLOGOUS TO PARAFIBROMIN, VERNALIZATION INDEPENDENCE2 (VIP2)/EARLY FLOWERING7 (ELF7), VIP3, VIP4, VIP5, and VIP6/ELF8] showed temperature-insensitive early flowering across a broad temperature range (10 degrees C-27 degrees C). Flowering of PAF1C-deficient mutants at 10 degrees C was even earlier than that in flc, flm, and flc flm mutants, suggesting that PAF1C regulates additional factors. Indeed, RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) of PAF1C-deficient mutants revealed downregulation of MAF2-MAF5 in addition to FLC and FLM at both 10 and 23 degrees C. Consistent with the reduced expression of FLC and the FLC-clade members FLM/MAF1 and MAF2-MAF5, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-quantitative PCR assays showed reduced levels of the permissive epigenetic modification H3K4me3/H3K36me3 and increased levels of the repressive modification H3K27me3 at their chromatin. Knocking down MAF2-MAF5 using artificial microRNAs (amiRNAs) in the flc flm background (35S::amiR-MAF2-5 flc flm) resulted in significantly earlier flowering than flc flm mutants and even earlier than short vegetative phase (svp) mutants at 10 degrees C. Wild-type seedlings showed higher accumulation of FLC and FLC-clade gene transcripts at 10 degrees C compared to 23 degrees C. Our yeast two-hybrid assays and in vivo co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) analyses revealed that MAF2-MAF5 directly interact with the prominent floral repressor SVP. Late flowering caused by SVP overexpression was almost completely suppressed by the elf7 and vip4 mutations, suggesting that SVP-mediated floral repression required a functional PAF1C. Taken together, our results showed that PAF1C regulates the transcription of FLC and FLC-clade genes to modulate temperature-responsive flowering at a broad range of temperatures and that the interaction between SVP and these FLC-clade proteins is important for floral repression.

AB  - Our results show that SPL12 plays a crucial role in regulating nodule development in Medicago sativa L. (alfalfa), and that AGL6 is targeted and downregulated by SPL12. Root architecture in plants is critical because of its role in controlling nutrient cycling, water use efficiency and response to biotic and abiotic stress factors. The small RNA, microRNA156 (miR156), is highly conserved in plants, where it functions by silencing a group of SQUAMOSA-PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE (SPL) transcription factors. We previously showed that transgenic Medicago sativa (alfalfa) plants overexpressing miR156 display increased nodulation, improved nitrogen fixation and enhanced root regenerative capacity during vegetative propagation. In alfalfa, transcripts of eleven SPLs, including SPL12, are targeted for cleavage by miR156. In this study, we characterized the role of SPL12 in root architecture and nodulation by investigating the transcriptomic and phenotypic changes associated with altered transcript levels of SPL12, and by determining SPL12 regulatory targets using SPL12-silencing and -overexpressing alfalfa plants. Phenotypic analyses showed that silencing of SPL12 in alfalfa caused an increase in root regeneration, nodulation, and nitrogen fixation. In addition, AGL6 which encodes AGAMOUS-like MADS box transcription factor, was identified as being directly targeted for silencing by SPL12, based on Next Generation Sequencing-mediated transcriptome analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Taken together, our results suggest that SPL12 and AGL6 form a genetic module that regulates root development and nodulation in alfalfa.

AB  - The self-renewal characteristics of stem cells render them vital engines of development. To better understand the molecular mechanisms that determine the properties of stem cells, transcript profiling was conducted on quiescent center (QC) cells from the Arabidopsis thaliana root meristem. The AGAMOUS-LIKE 42 (AGL42) gene, which encodes a MADS box transcription factor whose expression is enriched in the QC, was used to mark these cells. RNA was isolated from sorted cells, labeled, and hybridized to Affymetrix microarrays. Comparisons with digital in situ expression profiles of surrounding tissues identified a set of genes enriched in the QC. Promoter regions from a subset of transcription factors identified as enriched in the QC conferred expression in the QC. These studies demonstrated that it is possible to successfully isolate and profile a rare cell type in the plant. Mutations in all enriched transcription factor genes including AGL42 exhibited no detectable root phenotype, raising the possibility of a high degree of functional redundancy in the QC.

AB  - MADS-box transcription factors (TFs) have not been functionally delineated in microalgae. In this study, the role of CsubMADS1 from microalga Coccomyxa subellipsoidea C-169 has been explored. Unlike Type II MADS-box proteins of seed plants with MADS, Intervening, K-box, and C domains, CsubMADS1 only has MADS and Intervening domains. It forms a group with MADS TFs from algae in the phylogenetic tree within the Type II MIKC(C) clade. CsubMADS1 is expressed strongly in the lag phase of growth. The CsubMADS1 monomer does not have a specific localization in the nucleus, and it forms homodimers to localize exclusively in the nucleus. The monomer has two nuclear localization signals (NLSs): an N-terminal NLS and an internal NLS. The internal NLS is functional, and the homodimer requires two NLSs for specific nuclear localization. Overexpression (OX) of CsubMADS1 slows down the growth of the culture and leads to the creation of giant polyploid multinucleate cells, resembling autospore mother cells. This implies that the release of autospores from autospore mother cells may be delayed. Thus, in wild-type (WT) cells, CsubMADS1 may play a crucial role in slowing down growth during the lag phase. Due to starvation in 2-month-old colonies on solid media, the WT colonies produce mucilage, whereas OX colonies produce significantly less mucilage. Thus, CsubMADS1 also negatively regulates stress-induced mucilage production and probably plays a role in stress tolerance during the lag phase. Taken together, our results reveal that CsubMADS1 is a key TF involved in the development and stress tolerance of this polar microalga.

AB  - At all stages of f lowering, a decisive role is played by the family of MADS-domain transcription factors, the combinatorial action of which is described by the ABCDE-model of f lower development. The current volume of data suggests a high conservatism of ABCDE genes in angiosperms. The E-proteins SEPALLATA are the central hub of the MADS-complexes, which determine the identity of the f loral organs. The only representative of the SEPALLATA3 clade in tomato Solanum lycopersicum L., SlMADS5, is involved in determining the identity of petals, stamens, and carpels; however, data on the functions of the gene are limited. The study was focused on the SlMADS5 functional characterization. Structural and phylogenetic analyses of SlMADS5 conf irmed its belonging to the SEP3 clade. An in silico expression analysis revealed the absence of gene transcripts in roots, leaves, and shoot apical meristem, and their presence in f lowers, fruits, and seeds at different stages of development. Two-hybrid analysis showed the ability of SlMADS5 to activate transcription of the target gene and interact with TAGL1. Transgenic plants Nicotiana tabacum L. with constitutive overexpression of SlMADS5 cDNA f lowered 2.2 times later than the control; plants formed thickened leaves, 2.5-3.0 times thicker stems, 1.5-2.7 times shortened internodes, and 1.9 times fewer f lowers and capsules than non-transgenic plants. The f lower structure did not differ from the control; however, the corolla petals changed color from light pink to magenta. Analysis of the expression of SlMADS5 and the tobacco genes NtLFY, NtAP1, NtWUS, NtAG, NtPLE, NtSEP1, NtSEP2, and NtSEP3 in leaves and apexes of transgenic and control plants showed that SlMADS5 mRNA is present only in tissues of transgenic lines. The other genes analyzed were highly expressed in the reproductive meristem of control plants. Gene transcripts were absent or were imperceptibly present in the leaves and vegetative apex of the control, as well as in the leaves and apexes of transgenic lines. The results obtained indicate the possible involvement of SlMADS5 in the regulation of f lower meristem development and the pathway of anthocyanin biosynthesis in petals.

AB  - We previously identified the FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC)-like gene, a MADS-box transcription factor gene that belongs to Arabidopsis thaliana L. FLC clade, in apple (Malus $\times$ domestica Borkh.), and its expression in dormant flower buds is positively correlated with cumulative cold exposure. To elucidate the role of the MdFLC-like in the dormancy process and flower development, we first characterized the phenotypes of MdFLC-like overexpressing lines with the Arabidopsis Columbia-0 background. The overexpression of MdFLC-like significantly delayed the bolting date and reduced the plant size, but it did not significantly affect the number of rosette leaves or flower organ formation. Thus, MdFLC-like may affect vegetative growth and development rather than flowering when expressed in Arabidopsis, which is not like Arabidopsis FLC that affects development of flowering. We compared seasonal expression patterns of MdFLC-like in low-chill 'Anna' and high-chill 'Fuji' and 'Tsugaru' apples collected from trees grown in a cold winter region in temperate zone and found an earlier upregulation in 'Anna' compared with 'Fuji' and 'Tsugaru'. Expression patterns were also compared in relation to developmental changes in the flower primordia during the chilling accumulation period. Overall, MdFLC-like was progressively upregulated during flower primordia differentiation and development in autumn to early winter and reached a maximum expression level at around the same time as the genotype-dependent chilling requirements were fulfilled in high-chill cultivars. Thus, we hypothesize MdFLC-like may be upregulated in response to cold exposure and flower primordia development during the progress of endodormancy. Our study also suggests MdFLC-like may have a growth-inhibiting function during the end of endodormancy and ecodormancy when the temperature is low and unfavorable for rapid bud outgrowth.

AB  - Bud dormancy in perennial plants is indispensable to survival over winter and to regrowth and development in the following year. However, the molecular pathways of endo-dormancy induction, maintenance, and release are still unclear, especially in fruit crops. To identify genes with roles in regulating endo-dormancy, 30 MIKC(C)-type MADS-box genes were identified in the pear genome and characterized. The 30 genes were analysed to determine their phylogenetic relationships with homologous genes, genome locations, gene structure, tissue-specific transcript profiles, and transcriptional patterns during flower bud dormancy in 'Suli' pear (Pyrus pyrifolia white pear group). The roles in regulating bud dormancy varied among the MIKC gene family members. Yeast one-hybrid and transient assays showed that PpCBF enhanced PpDAM1 and PpDAM3 transcriptional activity during the induction of dormancy, probably by binding to the C-repeat/DRE binding site, while DAM proteins inhibited the transcriptional activity of PpFT2 during dormancy release. In the small RNA-seq analysis, 185 conserved, 24 less-conserved, and 32 pear-specific miRNAs with distinct expression patterns during bud dormancy were identified. Joint analyses of miRNAs and MIKC genes together with degradome data showed that miR6390 targeted PpDAM transcripts and degraded them to release PpFT2. Our data show that cross-talk among PpCBF, PpDAM, PpFT2, and miR6390 played important roles in regulating endo-dormancy. A model for the molecular mechanism of dormancy transition is proposed: short-term chilling in autumn activates the accumulation of CBF, which directly promotes DAM expression; DAM subsequently inhibits FT expression to induce endo-dormancy, and miR6390 degrades DAM genes to release endo-dormancy.

AB  - The embryogenic transition of somatic cells requires an extensive reprogramming of the cell transcriptome. Relevantly, the extensive modulation of the genes that have a regulatory function, in particular the genes encoding the transcription factors (TFs) and miRNAs, have been indicated as controlling somatic embryogenesis (SE) that is induced in vitro in the somatic cells of plants. Identifying the regulatory relationships between the TFs and miRNAs during SE induction is of central importance for understanding the complex regulatory interplay that fine-tunes a cell transcriptome during the embryogenic transition. Hence, here, we analysed the regulatory relationships between AGL15 (AGAMOUS-LIKE 15) TF and miR156 in an embryogenic culture of Arabidopsis. Both AGL15 and miR156 control SE induction and AGL15 has been reported to target the MIR156 genes in planta. The results showed that AGL15 contributes to the regulation of miR156 in an embryogenic culture at two levels that involve the activation of the MIR156 transcription and the containment of the abundance of mature miR156 by repressing the miRNA biogenesis genes DCL1 (DICER-LIKE1), SERRATE and HEN1 (HUA-ENHANCER1). To repress the miRNA biogenesis genes AGL15 seems to co-operate with the TOPLESS co-repressors (TPL and TPR1-4), which are components of the SIN3/HDAC silencing complex. The impact of TSA (trichostatin A), an inhibitor of the HDAC histone deacetylases, on the expression of the miRNA biogenesis genes together with the ChIP results implies that histone deacetylation is involved in the AGL15-mediated repression of miRNA processing. The results indicate that HDAC6 and HDAC19 histone deacetylases might co-operate with AGL15 in silencing the complex that controls the abundance of miR156 during embryogenic induction. This study provides new evidence about the histone acetylation-mediated control of the miRNA pathways during the embryogenic reprogramming of plant somatic cells and the essential role of AGL15 in this regulatory mechanism.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in regulating flowering and reproduction of angiosperms. Mature miRNAs are encoded by multiple MIRNA genes that can differ in their spatiotemporal activities and their contributions to gene regulatory networks, but the functions of individual MIRNA genes are poorly defined. We functionally analyzed the activity of all 5 Arabidopsis thaliana MIR172 genes, which encode miR172 and promote the floral transition by inhibiting the accumulation of APETALA2 (AP2) and APETALA2-LIKE (AP2-LIKE) transcription factors (TFs). Through genome editing and detailed confocal microscopy, we show that the activity of miR172 at the shoot apex is encoded by 3 MIR172 genes, is critical for floral transition of the shoot meristem under noninductive photoperiods, and reduces accumulation of AP2 and TARGET OF EAT2 (TOE2), an AP2-LIKE TF, at the shoot meristem. Utilizing the genetic resources generated here, we show that the promotion of flowering by miR172 is enhanced by the MADS-domain TF FRUITFULL, which may facilitate long-term silencing of AP2-LIKE transcription, and that their activities are partially coordinated by the TF SQUAMOSA PROMOTER-BINDING-LIKE PROTEIN 15. Thus, we present a genetic framework for the depletion of AP2 and AP2-LIKE TFs at the shoot apex during floral transition and demonstrate that this plays a central role in floral induction.

AB  - Floral organ identity and meristem determinacy in plants are controlled by combinations of activities mediated by MADS box genes. AGAMOUS-LIKE6 (AGL6)-like genes are MADS box genes expressed in floral tissues, but their biological functions are mostly unknown. Here, we describe an AGL6-like gene in rice (Oryza sativa), MOSAIC FLORAL ORGANS1 (MFO1/MADS6), that regulates floral organ identity and floral meristem determinacy. In the flower of mfo1 mutants, the identities of palea and lodicule are disturbed, and mosaic organs were observed. Furthermore, the determinacy of the floral meristem was lost, and extra carpels or spikelets developed in mfo1 florets. The expression patterns of floral MADS box genes were disturbed in the mutant florets. Suppression of another rice AGL6-like gene, MADS17, caused no morphological abnormalities in the wild-type background, but it enhanced the phenotype in the mfo1 background, indicating that MADS17 has a minor but redundant function with that of MFO1. Whereas single mutants in either MFO1 or the SEPALLATA-like gene LHS1 showed moderate phenotypes, the mfo1 lhs1 double mutant showed a severe phenotype, including the loss of spikelet meristem determinacy. We propose that rice AGL6-like genes help to control floral organ identity and the establishment and determinacy of the floral meristem redundantly with LHS1.

AB  - MADS-box genes are known to play important roles in diverse aspects of growth/devolopment and stress response in several plant species. However, no study has yet examined about MADS-box genes in P. vulgaris. In this study, a total of 79 PvMADS genes were identified and classified as type I and type II according to the phylogenetic analysis. While both type I and type II PvMADS classes were found to contain the MADS domain, the K domain was found to be present only in type II PvMADS proteins, in agreement with the literature. All chromosomes of the common bean were discovered to contain PvMADS genes and 17 paralogous gene pairs were identified. Only two of them were tandemly duplicated gene pairs (PvMADS-19/PvMADS-23 and PvMADS-20/PvMADS-24), and the remaining 15 paralogous gene pairs were segmentally duplicated genes. These duplications were found to play an important role in the expansion of type II PvMADS genes. Moreover, the RNAseq and RT-qPCR analyses showed the importance of PvMADS genes in response to drought stress in P. vulgaris.

AB  - MADS-box transcription factors (TFs) regulate functionally diverse gene targets in eukaryotes. In select ascomycetes, MADS-box TFs have been shown to play a role in virulence, and vegetative and sexual development. Here, we characterized Fusarium verticillioides MADS-box TFs, Mads1 and Mads2, in terms of their roles in secondary metabolism and sexual mating. Sequence analyses showed that MADS1 and MADS2 encode TFs with a SRF-type dimerization domain and a MEF2-type dimerization domain, respectively. The MADS1 and MADS2 knockout mutants (Fmt1 and Fmt2 strains, respectively) exhibited decreased vegetative growth and FB1 production when compared to the wild-type. Fmt1 showed reduced expression of 14 polyketide synthase (PKS) genes present in the organism, whereas Fmt2 did not display a change in PKS gene expression. Significantly, the deletion of MADS1 and MADS2 in the MAT1-2 genotype (Fmt4 and Fmt5 strains, respectively) led to strains that failed to produce perithecia and ascospores when crossed with the MAT1-1 wild-type strain. Notably, deletion of either gene did not have an effect on the ability of the fungus to colonize maize stalk or kernels. FB1 production and PKS expression data suggest that Mads1 is a broad regulator of secondary metabolism in F. verticillioides, and may target regulons upstream of Mads2 to influence FB1 production. In addition, MADS-box TFs in F. verticillioides play a critical role in the perithecia development.

AB  - The adaptive success of flowering plants is largely due to their ability to align floral production with optimal conditions. In Arabidopsis thaliana, MADS-box repressors of the FLC/MAF-clade prevent flowering under non-inductive conditions, although the role of some members is not yet clearly defined. Using a genetic strategy, we identified the KH-domain gene HEN4, previously shown to be involved in MADS-box floral homeotic gene regulation, as a modulator of flowering time. Loss-of-function hen4 mutants are early-flowering, and their response to low growth-temperature (16 degrees C) and day-length is altered. Interestingly, hen4 plants showed dramatic reduction of FLC and MAF4 transcripts, whereas other flowering repressors of the same clade (FLM, MAF2, MAF3, MAF5) remained unaltered. We also determined that hen4, partly due to loss of FLC, accelerates the vegetative phase-change. This report provides insight into flowering time control and highlights the potential of versatile regulators such as HEN4 to coordinate the juvenile-to-adult transition and floral timing.

AB  - In angiosperms, floral homeotic genes encoding MADS-domain transcription factors regulate the development of floral organs. Specifically, members of the SEPALLATA (SEP) and AGAMOUS (AG) subfamilies form higher-order protein complexes to control floral meristem determinacy and to specify the identity of female reproductive organs. In rice, the AG subfamily gene OsMADS13 is intimately involved in the determination of ovule identity, since knock-out mutant plants develop carpel-like structures in place of ovules, resulting in female sterility. Little is known about the regulatory pathways at the base of rice gynoecium development. To investigate molecular mechanisms acting downstream of OsMADS13, we obtained transcriptomes of immature inflorescences from wild-type and Osmads13 mutant plants. Among a total of 476 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), a substantial overlap with DEGs from the SEP-family Osmads1 mutant was found, suggesting that OsMADS1 and OsMADS13 may act on a common set of target genes. Expression studies and preliminary analyses of two up-regulated genes encoding Zinc-finger transcription factors indicated that our dataset represents a valuable resource for the identification of both OsMADS13 target genes and novel players in rice ovule development. Taken together, our study suggests that OsMADS13 is an important repressor of the carpel pathway during ovule development.

AB  - The genetic mechanisms regulating dry fruit development and opercular dehiscence have been identified in Arabidopsis thaliana. In the bicarpellate silique, valve elongation and differentiation is controlled by FRUITFULL (FUL) that antagonizes SHATTERPROOF1-2 (SHP1/SHP2) and INDEHISCENT (IND) at the dehiscence zone where they control normal lignification. SHP1/2 are also repressed by REPLUMLESS (RPL), responsible for replum formation. Similarly, FUL indirectly controls two other factors ALCATRAZ (ALC) and SPATULA (SPT) that function in the proper formation of the separation layer. FUL and SHP1/2 belong to the MADS-box family, IND and ALC belong to the bHLH family and RPL belongs to the homeodomain family, all of which are large transcription factor families. These families have undergone numerous duplications and losses in plants, likely accompanied by functional changes. Functional analyses of homologous genes suggest that this network is fairly conserved in Brassicaceae and less conserved in other core eudicots. Only the MADS box genes have been functionally characterized in basal eudicots and suggest partial conservation of the functions recorded for Brassicaceae. Here we do a comprehensive search of SHP, IND, ALC, SPT, and RPL homologs across core-eudicots, basal eudicots, monocots and basal angiosperms. Based on gene-tree analyses we hypothesize what parts of the network for fruit development in Brassicaceae, in particular regarding direct and indirect targets of FUL, might be conserved across angiosperms.

AB  - Nitrate is an important nutrient and a key signalling molecule for plant development. A number of transcription factors involved in the response to nitrate and their regulatory mechanisms have been identified. However, little is known about the transcription factors involved in nitrate sensing and their regulatory mechanisms among crop plants. In this study, we identified functions of a nitrate-responsive miR444:MADS-box transcription factor OsMADS27 module and its downstream targets mediating rice root growth and stress responses. Transgenic rice plants expressing miR444 target mimic improved rice root growth. Although miR444 has the potential to target multiple genes, we identified OsMADS27 as the major miR444 target that regulates the expression of nitrate transporters, as well as several key genes including expansins, and those associated with auxin signalling, to promote root growth. In agreement with this, overexpression of miRNA-resistant OsMADS27 improved root development and tolerance to abiotic stresses, while its silencing suppressed root growth. OsMADS27 mediated robust stress tolerance in plants through its ability to bind to the promoters of specific stress regulators, as observed in ChIP-seq analysis. Our results provide evidence of a nitrate-dependent miR444-OsMADS27 signalling cascade involved in the regulation of rice root growth, as well as its surprising role in stress responses.

AB  - Background and Aims The Arabidopsis thaliana root is a key experimental system in developmental biology. Despite its importance, we are still lacking an objective and broadly applicable approach for identification of number and position of developmental domains or zones along the longitudinal axis of the root apex or boundaries between them, which is essential for understanding the mechanisms underlying cell proliferation, elongation and differentiation dynamics during root development. Methods We used a statistics approach, the multiple structural change algorithm (MSC), for estimating the number and position of developmental transitions in the growing portion of the root apex. Once the positions of the transitions between domains and zones were determined, linear models were used to estimate the critical size of dividing cells (LcritD) and other parameters. Key Results The MSC approach enabled identification of three discrete regions in the growing parts of the root that correspond to the proliferation domain (PD), the transition domain (TD) and the elongation zone (EZ). Simultaneous application of the MSC approach and G2-to-M transition (CycB1;1DB:GFP) and endoreduplication (pCCS52A1:GUS) molecular markers confirmed the presence and position of the TD. We also found that the MADS-box gene XAANTAL1 (XAL1) is required for the wild-type (wt) PD increase in length during the first 2 weeks of growth. Contrary to wt, in the xal1 loss-of-function mutant the increase and acceleration of root growth were not detected. We also found alterations in LcritD in xal1 compared with wt, which was associated with longer cell cycle duration in the mutant. Conclusions The MSC approach is a useful, objective and versatile tool for identification of the PD, TD and EZ and boundaries between them in the root apices and can be used for the phenotyping of different genetic backgrounds, experimental treatments or developmental changes within a genotype. The tool is publicly available at www.ibiologia.com.mx/MSC_analysis.

AB  - MADS-box transcription factors (TFs) are involved in a variety of processes in flowering plants ranging from root growth to flower and fruit development. However, studies of the tolerance-related functions of MADS-box genes are very limited, and to date no such studies have been conducted on Camellia sinensis. To gain insight into the functions of genes of this family and to elucidate the role they may play in tissue development and Al and F response, we identified 45 MADS-box genes through transcriptomic analysis of C. sinensis. Phylogenetic analysis of these CsMADS-box genes, along with their homologues in Arabidopsis thaliana, enabled us to classify them into distinct groups, including: M-type (Malpha), MIKC* and MIKC(c) (which contains the SOC1, AGL12, AGL32, SEP, ANR1, SVP, and FLC subgroups). Conserved motif analysis of the CsMADS-box proteins revealed diverse motif compositions indicating a complex evolutionary relationship. Finally, we examined the expression patterns of CsMADS-box genes in various tissues and under different Al and F concentration treatments. Our qPCR results showed that these CsMADS-box genes were involved in Al and F accumulation and root growth in C. sinensis. These findings lay the foundation for future research on the function of CsMADS-box genes and their role in response to Al and F accumulation in root tissues.

AB  - Orchidaceae are an excellent model to examine perianth development because of their sophisticated floral architecture. In this study, we identified 24 APETALA3 (AP3)-like and 13 PISTILLA (PI)-like genes from 11 species of orchids and characterized them into four AP3- and two PI-duplicated homologs. The first duplication event in AP3 homologs occurring in the early evolutionary history of the Orchidaceae gave rise to AP3A and AP3B clades. Further duplication events resulted in four subclades, namely AP3A1, AP3A2, AP3B1 and AP3B2, during the evolution of Orchidaceae. The AP3 paralogous genes were expressed throughout inflorescence and floral bud development. From the in situ hybridization results, we noticed that the transition timings from ubiquitous to constrained expression in floral organs for both clades are different. The transition point of expression of the AP3A clade (clades 3 and 4) was at the late floral organ primordia stage. In contrast, that for the AP3B clade (clades 1 and 2) was not observed until the late inflorescence and floral bud stages. In addition, the AP3 orthologous genes revealed diverse expression patterns in various species of orchids, whereas the PI homologs were uniformly expressed in all floral whorls. AP3A2 orthologs play a noticeable role in lip formation because of their exclusive expression in the lip. Further evidence comes from the ectopic expression of AP3A2 detected in the lip-like petals extending from the lip in four sets of peloric mutants. Finally, a Homeotic Orchid Tepal (HOT) model is proposed, in which dualistic characters of duplicated B-class MADS-box genes are involved in orchid perianth development and growth.

AB  - A deep understanding of the genetic control of drought tolerance and iron deficiency tolerance is essential to hasten the process of developing improved varieties with higher tolerance through genomics-assisted breeding. In this context, an improved genetic map with 1205 loci was developed spanning 2598.3 cM with an average 2.2 cM distance between loci in the recombinant inbred line (TAG 24 x ICGV 86031) population using high-density 58K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) "Axiom_Arachis" array. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis was performed using extensive phenotyping data generated for 20 drought tolerance- and two iron deficiency tolerance-related traits from eight seasons (2004-2015) at two locations in India, one in Niger, and one in Senegal. The genome-wide QTL discovery analysis identified 19 major main-effect QTLs with 10.0-33.9% phenotypic variation explained (PVE) for drought tolerance- and iron deficiency tolerance- related traits. Major main-effect QTLs were detected for haulm weight (20.1% PVE), SCMR (soil plant analytical development (SPAD) chlorophyll meter reading, 22.4% PVE), and visual chlorosis rate (33.9% PVE). Several important candidate genes encoding glycosyl hydrolases; malate dehydrogenases; microtubule-associated proteins; and transcription factors such as MADS-box, basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH), NAM, ATAF, and CUC (NAC), and myeloblastosis (MYB) were identified underlying these QTL regions. The putative function of these genes indicated their possible involvement in plant growth, development of seed and pod, and photosynthesis under drought or iron deficiency conditions in groundnut. These genomic regions and candidate genes, after validation, may be useful to develop molecular markers for deploying genomics-assisted breeding for enhancing groundnut yield under drought stress and iron-deficient soil conditions.

AB  - Seed development is under the control of complex and coordinated molecular networks required for the formation of its different components. The seed coat development largely determines final seed size and shape, in addition to playing a crucial role in protecting the embryo and promoting germination. In this study, we investigated the role of three transcription factors known to be active during seed development in Arabidopsis thaliana: SEEDSTICK (STK) and GORDITA (GOA), two MADS-domain proteins, and AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 2 (ARF2), belonging to the ARF family. Through a reverse genetic approach, we characterized the seed phenotypes of all the single, double and triple loss-of-function mutants in relation to seed size/shape and the effects on metabolic pathways occurring in the seed coat. This approach revealed that dynamic networks involving these TFs are active throughout ovule and seed development, affecting the formation of the seed coat. Notably, while the genetic interaction among these genes results in synergies that control the promotion of cell expansion in the seed coat upon pollination and production of proanthocyanidins, functional antagonists arise in the control of cell proliferation and release of mucilage.

AB  - Seed size is the result of complex molecular networks controlling the development of the seed coat (of maternal origin) and the two fertilization products, the embryo and the endosperm. In this study we characterized the role of Arabidopsis thaliana MADS-domain transcription factor SEEDSTICK (STK) in seed size control. STK is known to regulate the differentiation of the seed coat as well as the structural and mechanical properties of cell walls in developing seeds. In particular, we further characterized stk mutant seeds. Genetic evidence (reciprocal crosses) of the inheritance of the small-seed phenotype, together with the provided analysis of cell division activity (flow cytometry), demonstrate that STK acts in the earlier phases of seed development as a maternal activator of growth. Moreover, we describe a molecular mechanism underlying this activity by reporting how STK positively regulates cell cycle progression via directly activating the expression of E2Fa, a key regulator of the cell cycle. Altogether, our results unveil a new genetic network active in the maternal control of seed size in Arabidopsis.

AB  - MADS-box transcription factors are key regulators of several plant development processes. Analysis of the complete Arabidopsis genome sequence revealed 107 genes encoding MADS-box proteins, of which 84% are of unknown function. Here, we provide a complete overview of this family, describing the gene structure, gene expression, genome localization, protein motif organization, and phylogenetic relationship of each member. We have divided this transcription factor family into five groups (named MIKC, Malpha, Mbeta, Mgamma, and Mdelta) based on the phylogenetic relationships of the conserved MADS-box domain. This study provides a solid base for functional genomics studies into this important family of plant regulatory genes, including the poorly characterized group of M-type MADS-box proteins. MADS-box genes also constitute an excellent system with which to study the evolution of complex gene families in higher plants.

AB  - The large dynamic range of gene expression changes accompanying floral organ abscission can be explained by a molecular positive feedback loop that regulates the process. In short, a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, positioned genetically downstream from the abscission receptor HAESA (HAE), phosphorylates the transcription factor, AGAMOUS-like 15 (AGL15), allowing HAE to be expressed. However, it is unknown which residues of AGL15 are phosphorylated and precisely how phosphorylation alters AGL15 function. Here we report that serine 231 and 257 of AGL15 are phosphorylated in floral receptacles. Effects of phosphorylation on AGL15 are discussed.

AB  - AGAMOUS-Like 18 (AGL18) is a MADS domain transcription factor (TF) that is structurally related to AGL15. Here we show that, like AGL15, AGL18 can promote somatic embryogenesis (SE) when ectopically expressed in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Based on loss-of-function mutants, AGL15 and AGL18 have redundant functions in developmental processes such as SE. To understand the nature of this redundancy, we undertook a number of studies to look at the interaction between these factors. We studied the genome-wide direct targets of AGL18 to characterize its roles at the molecular level using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-SEQ combined with RNA-SEQ. The results demonstrated that AGL18 binds to thousands of sites in the genome. Comparison of ChIP-SEQ data for AGL15 and AGL18 revealed substantial numbers of genes bound by both AGL15 and AGL18, but there were also differences. Gene ontology analysis revealed that target genes were enriched for seed, embryo, and reproductive development as well as hormone and stress responses. The results also demonstrated that AGL15 and AGL18 interact in a complex regulatory loop, where AGL15 inhibited transcript accumulation of AGL18, while AGL18 increased AGL15 transcript accumulation. Co-immunoprecipitation revealed an interaction between AGL18 and AGL15 in somatic embryo tissue. The binding and expression analyses revealed a complex crosstalk and interactions among embryo TFs and their target genes. In addition, our study also revealed that phosphorylation of AGL18 and AGL15 was crucial for the promotion of SE.

AB  - The MADS domain transcription factor AGAMOUS (AG) regulates floral meristem termination by preventing maintenance of the histone modification lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3) along the KNUCKLES (KNU) coding sequence. At 2 d after AG binding, cell division has diluted the repressive mark H3K27me3, allowing activation of KNU transcription prior to floral meristem termination. However, how many other downstream genes are temporally regulated by this intrinsic epigenetic timer and what their functions are remain unknown. Here, we identify direct AG targets regulated through cell cycle-coupled H3K27me3 dilution in Arabidopsis thaliana. Expression of the targets KNU, AT HOOK MOTIF NUCLEAR LOCALIZED PROTEIN18 (AHL18), and PLATZ10 occurred later in plants with longer H3K27me3-marked regions. We established a mathematical model to predict timing of gene expression and manipulated temporal gene expression using the H3K27me3-marked del region from the KNU coding sequence. Increasing the number of del copies delayed and reduced KNU expression in a polycomb repressive complex 2- and cell cycle-dependent manner. Furthermore, AHL18 was specifically expressed in stamens and caused developmental defects when misexpressed. Finally, AHL18 bound to genes important for stamen growth. Our results suggest that AG controls the timing of expression of various target genes via cell cycle-coupled dilution of H3K27me3 for proper floral meristem termination and stamen development.

AB  - Abnormal flowers have been recognized for thousands of years, but only in the past decade have the mysteries of flower development begun to unfold. Among these mysteries is the differentiation of four distinct organ types (sepals, petals, stamens and carpels), each of which may be a modified leaf. A landmark accomplishment in plant developmental biology is the ABC model of flower organ identity. This simple model provides a conceptual framework for explaining how the individual and combined activities of the ABC genes produce the four organ types of the typical eudicot flower. Here we show that the activities of the B and C organ-identity genes require the activities of three closely related and functionally redundant MADS-box genes, SEPALLATA1/2/3 (SEP1/2/3). Triple mutant Arabidopsis plants lacking the activity of all three SEP genes produce flowers in which all organs develop as sepals. Thus SEP1/2/3 are a class of organ-identity genes that is required for development of petals, stamens and carpels.

AB  - Floral identity MADS-box A, B, C, D, E, and AGL6 class genes are predominantly single copy in Magnoliids, and predate the whole genome duplication (WGD) events in monocots and eudicots. By comparison with the model species Arabidopsis thaliana, the expression patterns of B-, C-, and D-class genes in stamen, carpel, and ovules are conserved in Aristolochia fimbriata, whereas A-, E-class, and AGL6 genes have different expression patterns. Nevertheless, the interactions of these proteins that act through multimeric complexes remain poorly known in early divergent angiosperms. This study evaluates protein interactions among all floral MADS-box A. fimbriata proteins using the Yeast Two Hybrid System (Y2H). We found no homodimers and less heterodimers formed by AfimFUL when compared to AfimAGL6, which allowed us to suggest AGL6 homodimers in combination with AfimSEP2 as the most likely tetramer in sepal identity. We found AfimAP3-AfimPI obligate heterodimers and AfimAG-AfimSEP2 protein interactions intact suggesting conserved stamen and carpel tetrameric complexes in A. fimbriata. We observed a broader interaction partner set for AfimSEP2 than for its paralog AfimSEP1. We show conserved and exclusive MADS-box protein interactions in A. fimbriata in comparison with other eudicot and monocot model species in order to establish plesiomorphic MADS-box protein floral networks in angiosperms.

AB  - In Arabidopsis thaliana, multiple genes involved in shoot apical meristem (SAM) transitions have been characterized, but the mechanisms required for the dynamic attainment of vegetative, inflorescence, and floral meristem (VM, IM, FM) cell fates during SAM transitions are not well understood. Here we show that a MADS-box gene, XAANTAL2 (XAL2/AGL14), is necessary and sufficient to induce flowering, and its regulation is important in FM maintenance and determinacy. xal2 mutants are late flowering, particularly under short-day (SD) condition, while XAL2 overexpressing plants are early flowering, but their flowers have vegetative traits. Interestingly, inflorescences of the latter plants have higher expression levels of LFY, AP1, and TFL1 than wild-type plants. In addition we found that XAL2 is able to bind the TFL1 regulatory regions. On the other hand, the basipetal carpels of the 35S::XAL2 lines lose determinacy and maintain high levels of WUS expression under SD condition. To provide a mechanistic explanation for the complex roles of XAL2 in SAM transitions and the apparently paradoxical phenotypes of XAL2 and other MADS-box (SOC1, AGL24) overexpressors, we conducted dynamic gene regulatory network (GRN) and epigenetic landscape modeling. We uncovered a GRN module that underlies VM, IM, and FM gene configurations and transition patterns in wild-type plants as well as loss and gain of function lines characterized here and previously. Our approach thus provides a novel mechanistic framework for understanding the complex basis of SAM development.

AB  - Root chicory (Cichorium intybus var. sativum) is a biennial crop, but is harvested to obtain root inulin at the end of the first growing season before flowering. However, cold temperatures may vernalize seeds or plantlets, leading to incidental early flowering, and hence understanding the molecular basis of vernalization is important. A MADS box sequence was isolated by RT-PCR and named FLC-LIKE1 (CiFL1) because of its phylogenetic positioning within the same clade as the floral repressor Arabidopsis FLOWERING LOCUS C (AtFLC). Moreover, over-expression of CiFL1 in Arabidopsis caused late flowering and prevented up-regulation of the AtFLC target FLOWERING LOCUS T by photoperiod, suggesting functional conservation between root chicory and Arabidopsis. Like AtFLC in Arabidopsis, CiFL1 was repressed during vernalization of seeds or plantlets of chicory, but repression of CiFL1 was unstable when the post-vernalization temperature was favorable to flowering and when it de-vernalized the plants. This instability of CiFL1 repression may be linked to the bienniality of root chicory compared with the annual lifecycle of Arabidopsis. However, re-activation of AtFLC was also observed in Arabidopsis when a high temperature treatment was used straight after seed vernalization, eliminating the promotive effect of cold on flowering. Cold-induced down-regulation of a MADS box floral repressor and its re-activation by high temperature thus appear to be conserved features of the vernalization and de-vernalization responses in distant species.

AB  - In contrast to well-studied dicot plants like Arabidopsis and Antirrhinum, relatively few genes controlling the transition to flowering and flower development of agronomically important monocot species have been identified. In perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth is triggered by an obligate vernalization period (primary induction) of at least 12 weeks at temperatures below 5 degrees C under short days, followed by increased temperature and day length (secondary induction). Here we report the isolation of nine ryegrass MADS-box (LpMADS) genes by a differential display method specific to this family of transcription factors. Three of the nine MADS-box genes show homology to the APETALA 1 (AP1) subfamily, two to the SEPALLATA (SEP) subfamily, one to the AGAMOUS-LIKE 6 (AGL6) subfamily, and three show homology to the newly identified OsMADS1 subfamily. The three AP1 homologues are up-regulated, both in the shoot apex and in leaves, in response to vernalization, while expression of the other six are increased by secondary induction during inflorescence development, although not in leaves. Differences in the sequence and hierarchy of flowering gene expression patterns indicate that the Arabidopsis-based flowering model is not completely applicable to explain the molecular events leading to the floral transition in grasses.

AB  - Many plants in temperate regions have a requirement for vernalization in order to initiate the reproductive growth phase. In cereals, this requirement has been linked to the VRN1 locus, which encodes an APETALA1-like (AP1-like) MADS-box gene. In perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.), we have isolated two MADS-box genes that are regulated by vernalization, LpMADS1, which co-localize to the VRN1 locus in ryegrass, and LpMADS10, which is an SVP-like MADS-box gene. In the shoot apex, LpMADS1 is increasingly induced by cold exposure, whereas LpMADS10 is increasingly repressed. Comparison of LpMADS1 promoter regions from several ryegrass varieties, with and without vernalization requirement, suggests that a putative MADS-box protein-binding site (CArG-box) might be important for the vernalization-regulated expression of LpMADS1. Although the LpMADS10 expression pattern suggests it to be involved in floral repression, ectopic expression of LpMADS10 did neither affect flowering time significantly in Arabidopsis thaliana nor in L. perenne. Interestingly, we found that LpMADS1 interacts with LpMADS10 in a yeast two-hybrid assay. This finding is discussed in regard to the regulation of vernalization response in perennial ryegrass.

AB  - The BASIC PENTACYSTEINE (BPC) GAGA (C-box) binding proteins belong to a small plant transcription factor family. We previously reported that class I BPCs bind directly to C-boxes in the SEEDSTICK (STK) promoter and the mutagenesis of these cis-elements affects STK expression in the flower. The MADS-domain factor SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) is another key regulator of STK. Direct binding of SVP to CArG-boxes in the STK promoter are required to repress its expression during the first stages of flower development. Here we show that class II BPCs directly interact with SVP and that MADS-domain binding sites in the STK promoter region are important for the correct spatial and temporal expression of this homeotic gene. Furthermore, we show that class I and class II BPCs act redundantly to repress STK expression in the flower, most likely by recruiting TERMINAL FLOWER 2/LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN 1 (TFL2/LHP1) and mediating the establishment and the maintenance of H3K27me3 repressive marks on DNA. We investigate the role of LHP1 in the regulation of STK expression. In addition to providing a better understanding of the role of BPC transcription factors in the regulation of STK expression, our results suggest the existence of a more general regulatory complex composed of BPCs, MADS-domain factors and Polycomb Repressive Complexes that co-operate to regulate gene expression in reproductive tissues. We believe that our data along with the molecular model described here could provide significant insights for a more comprehensive understanding of gene regulation in plants.

AB  - Flower and fruit development are two key steps for plant reproduction. The ABCE model for flower development has been well established in model plant species; however, the functions of ABCE genes in fruit crops are less understood. In this work, we identified an EMS mutant named R27 in woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca), showing the conversion of petals, stamens, and carpels to sepaloid organs in a semidominant inheritance fashion. Mapping by sequencing revealed that the class E gene homolog FveSEP3 (FvH4_4g23530) possessed the causative mutation in R27 due to a G to E amino acid change in the conserved MADS domain. Additional fvesep3(CR) mutants generated by CRISPR/Cas9 displayed similar phenotypes to fvesep3-R27. Overexpressing wild-type or mutated FveSEP3 in Arabidopsis suggested that the mutation in R27 might cause a dominant-negative effect. Further analyses indicated that FveSEP3 physically interacted with each of the ABCE proteins in strawberry. Moreover, both R27 and fvesep3(CR) mutants exhibited parthenocarpic fruit growth and delayed fruit ripening. Transcriptome analysis revealed that both common and specific differentially expressed genes were identified in young fruit at 6-7 days post anthesis (DPA) of fvesep3 and pollinated wild type when compared to unpollinated wild type, especially those in the auxin pathway, a key hormone regulating fruit set in strawberry. Together, we provided compelling evidence that FveSEP3 plays predominant E functions compared to other E gene homologs in flower development and that FveSEP3 represses fruit growth in the absence of pollination and promotes fruit ripening in strawberry.

AB  - In diploid wheat (Triticum monococcum), and likely in other Triticeae species, the VRN1 gene is essential for the initiation of the reproductive phase, and therefore, a detailed characterization of its regulatory regions is required to understand this process. A CArG-box (MADS-box-binding site) identified in the VRN1 promoter upstream from the transcription initiation site has been proposed as a critical regulatory element for the vernalization response. This hypothesis was supported by the genetic linkage between CArG-box natural deletions and dominant Vrn1 alleles for spring growth habit and by physical interactions with VRT2, a MADS-box protein proposed as a putative flowering repressor regulated by vernalization. Here, we describe a T. monococcum accession with a strong vernalization requirement and a 48-bp deletion encompassing the CArG-box in the VRN1 promoter. Genetic analyses of 2 segregating populations confirmed that this VRN1 allele is completely linked with a strong winter growth habit (vrn-A(m)1b). Transcript levels of the VRN1 allele with the 48-bp deletion were very low in unvernalized plants and increased during vernalization to levels similar to those detected in other wild-type vrn-A(m)1 alleles. Taken together, these results indicate that the CArG-box found upstream of the VRN1 transcription initiation site is not essential for the vernalization response.

AB  - FLOWERING LOCUS T-like (FT-like) genes control the photoperiodic regulation of flowering in many angiosperm plants. The family of FT-like genes is characterized by extensive gene duplication and subsequent diversification of FT functions which occurred independently in modern angiosperm lineages. In barley, there are 12 known FT-like genes (HvFT), but the function of most of them remains uncharacterized. This study aimed to characterize the role of HvFT4 in flowering time control and development in barley. The overexpression of HvFT4 in the spring cultivar Golden Promise delayed flowering time under long-day conditions. Microscopic dissection of the shoot apical meristem revealed that overexpression of HvFT4 specifically delayed spikelet initiation and reduced the number of spikelet primordia and grains per spike. Furthermore, ectopic overexpression of HvFT4 was associated with floret abortion and with the down-regulation of the barley MADS-box genes VRN-H1, HvBM3, and HvBM8 which promote floral development. This suggests that HvFT4 functions as a repressor of reproductive development in barley. Unraveling the genetic basis of FT-like genes can contribute to the identification of novel breeding targets to modify reproductive development and thereby spike morphology and grain yield.

AB  - Upon germination, pollen forms a tube that elongates dramatically through female tissues to reach and fertilize ovules. While essential for the life cycle of higher plants, the genetic basis underlying most of the process is not well understood. We previously used a combination of flow cytometry sorting of viable hydrated pollen grains and GeneChip array analysis of one-third of the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) genome to define a first overview of the pollen transcriptome. We now extend that study to approximately 80% of the genome of Arabidopsis by using Affymetrix Arabidopsis ATH1 arrays and perform comparative analysis of gene family and gene ontology representation in the transcriptome of pollen and vegetative tissues. Pollen grains have a smaller and overall unique transcriptome (6,587 genes expressed) with greater proportions of selectively expressed (11%) and enriched (26%) genes than any vegetative tissue. Relative gene ontology category representations in pollen and vegetative tissues reveal a functional skew of the pollen transcriptome toward signaling, vesicle transport, and the cytoskeleton, suggestive of a commitment to germination and tube growth. Cell cycle analysis reveals an accumulation of G2/M-associated factors that may play a role in the first mitotic division of the zygote. Despite the relative underrepresentation of transcription-associated transcripts, nonclassical MADS box genes emerge as a class with putative unique roles in pollen. The singularity of gene expression control in mature pollen grains is further highlighted by the apparent absence of small RNA pathway components.

AB  - Carpels are essential for sexual plant reproduction because they house the ovules and subsequently develop into fruits that protect, nourish and ultimately disperse the seeds. The AGAMOUS (AG) gene is necessary for plant sexual reproduction because stamens and carpels are absent from ag mutant flowers. However, the fact that sepals are converted into carpelloid organs in certain mutant backgrounds even in the absence of AG activity indicates that an AG-independent carpel-development pathway exists. AG is a member of a monophyletic clade of MADS-box genes that includes SHATTERPROOF1 (SHP1), SHP2 and SEEDSTICK (STK), indicating that these four genes might share partly redundant activities. Here we show that the SHP genes are responsible for AG-independent carpel development. We also show that the STK gene is required for normal development of the funiculus, an umbilical-cord-like structure that connects the developing seed to the fruit, and for dispersal of the seeds when the fruit matures. We further show that all four members of the AG clade are required for specifying the identity of ovules, the landmark invention during the course of vascular plant evolution that enabled seed plants to become the most successful group of land plants.

AB  - The tomato MADS box gene no. 5 (TM5) is shown here to be expressed in meristematic domains fated to form the three inner whorls-petals, stamens, and gynoecia-of the tomato flower. TM5 is also expressed during organogenesis and in the respective mature organs of these three whorls. This is unlike the major organ identity genes of the MADS box family from Antirrhinum and Arabidopsis, which function in overlapping primordial territories consisting of only two floral whorls each. The developmental relevance of the unique expression pattern of this putative homeotic gene was examined in transgenic plants. In agreement with the expression patterns, antisense RNA of the TM5 gene conferred both early and late alterations of morphogenetic markers. Early defects consist of additional whorls or of a wrong number of organs per whorl. Late, organ-specific changes include evergreen, cauline, and unabscised petals; green, dialytic, and sterile anthers; and sterile carpels and defective styles on which glandular trichomes characteristic of sepals and petals are ectopically formed. However, a complete homeotic transformation of either organ was not observed. The early and late floral phenotypes of TM5 antisense plants suggest that TM5 mediates two unrelated secondary regulatory systems. One system is the early function of the floral meristem identity genes, and the other system is the function of the major floral organ identity genes.

AB  - Direct regeneration of shoot buds in vitro is an important technique in plant genetic manipulation. We describe the isolation and functional characterization of a novel MADS box cDNA (PkMADS1) from Paulownia kawakamii leaf explants undergoing adventitious shoot regeneration. mRNA gel blot analysis confirmed the expression of PkMADS1 in the shoot-forming cultures, but no signal was observed in the callus-forming cultures. PkMADS1 transcripts were also detected in shoot apices, but not in root apices, initial leaf explants or the flower. In situ hybridization revealed that its expression was restricted to developing shoot primordia in the excised leaf cultures, suggesting a role for this gene in adventitious shoot formation. Transgenic Paulownia plants over-expressing the PkMADS1 gene showed some changes in phenotype, such as axillary shoot formation. In the antisense transformants, shoots were stunted and had altered phyllotaxy, and, in some lines, the shoot apical meristem appeared to have been used up early during shoot development. Leaf explants from the antisense transgenic plants showed a tenfold decrease in shoot regeneration compared with explants from sense transformants or wild-type. Our results show that PkMADS1 is a regulator of shoot morphogenesis.

AB  - Fruits play a crucial role in seed dispersal. They open along dehiscence zones. Fruit dehiscence zone formation has been intensively studied in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, little is known about the mechanisms and genes involved in the formation of fruit dehiscence zones in species outside the Brassicaceae. The dehiscence zone of A. thaliana contains a lignified layer, while dehiscence zone tissues of the emerging orchid model Erycina pusilla include a lipid layer. Here we present an analysis of evolution and development of fruit dehiscence zones in orchids. We performed ancestral state reconstructions across the five orchid subfamilies to study the evolution of selected fruit traits and explored dehiscence zone developmental genes using RNA-seq and qPCR. We found that erect dehiscent fruits with non-lignified dehiscence zones and a short ripening period are ancestral characters in orchids. Lignified dehiscence zones in orchid fruits evolved multiple times from non-lignified zones. Furthermore, we carried out gene expression analysis of tissues from different developmental stages of E. pusilla fruits. We found that fruit dehiscence genes from the MADS-box gene family and other important regulators in E. pusilla differed in their expression pattern from their homologs in A. thaliana. This suggests that the current A. thaliana fruit dehiscence model requires adjustment for orchids. Additionally, we discovered that homologs of A. thaliana genes involved in the development of carpel, gynoecium and ovules, and genes involved in lipid biosynthesis were expressed in the fruit valves of E. pusilla, implying that these genes may play a novel role in formation of dehiscence zone tissues in orchids. Future functional analysis of developmental regulators, lipid identification and quantification can shed more light on lipid-layer based dehiscence of orchid fruits.

AB  - The MADS-box family of transcription factors have diverse developmental roles in flower pattern formation, gametophyte cell division and fruit differentiation. The B-sister MADS-box proteins are most similar to the B-class floral homeotic proteins, and are expressed in female reproductive organs. The Arabidopsis B-sister MADS-box protein, TT16, is necessary for inner integument differentiation. We have functionally characterized the only other B-sister MADS-box gene in Arabidopsis, AGL63, renamed here as GORDITA (GOA). A loss-of-function mutation in goa or reduction of endogenous GOA expression results in larger fruits, illustrating its novel function in regulating fruit growth. Consistent with its function, GOA expression is detected in the walls of the valves and throughout the replum of the fruit. Our phenotypic and molecular analyses of 35S::GOA and goa plants show that GOA controls organ size via cell expansion. Further, functional studies of goa tt16 double mutants have shown their additive role in controlling seed coat development, and have revealed the importance of GOA expression in the outer integument. Together, our studies provide evidence of a new regulatory role for a B-sister MADS-box gene in the control of organ growth.

AB  - Basic questions regarding the origin and evolution of grass (Poaceae) inflorescence morphology remain unresolved, including the developmental genetic basis for evolution of the highly derived outer spikelet organs. To evaluate homologies between the outer sterile organs of grass spikelets and inflorescence structures of nongrass monocot flowers, we describe expression patterns of APETALA1/FRUITFULL-like (AP1/FUL) and LEAFY HULL STERILE-like (LHS1) MADS-box genes in an early-diverging grass (Streptochaeta angustifolia) and a nongrass outgroup (Joinvillea ascendens). AP1/FUL-like genes are expressed only in floral organs of J. ascendens, supporting the hypothesis that they mark the floral boundary in nongrass monocots, and JaLHS1/OsMADS5 is expressed in the inner and outer tepals, stamen filaments and pistil. In S. angustifolia, SaFUL2 is expressed in all 11 (or 12) bracts of the primary inflorescence branch, but not in the suppressed floral bract below the abscission zone. In contrast, SaLHS1 is only expressed in bracts 6-11 (or 12). Together, these data are consistent with the hypotheses that (1) bracts 1-5 of S. angustifolia primary inflorescence branches and glumes of grass spikelets are homologous and that (2) the outer tepals of immediate grass relatives, bracts 6-8 of S. angustifolia, and the lemma/palea are homologous, although other explanations are possible.

AB  - The formation mechanism of different ray floret shapes of chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum x morifolium) remains elusive due to its complex genetic background. C. vestitum, with the basic ray floret shapes of the flat, spoon, and tubular types, is considered a model material for studying ray floret morphogenesis. In this study, the flat and tubular type lines of C. vestitum at specific stages were used to investigate the key genes that regulate morphological differences in ray florets. We found that the expression levels of genes related to auxin synthesis, transport, and response were generally higher in the tubular type than in the flat type. CvARF3 was highly expressed in the flat type, while CvARF5 and CvARF6 were highly expressed in the tubular type. Additionally, the transcription levels of Class B and E genes closely related to petal development, including CvPI, CvAP3, Cvdefh21, CvSEP3, and CvCDM77, were expressed at higher levels in the tubular type than the flat type. Based on the results, it is proposed that auxin plays a key role in the development of ray florets, and auxin-related genes, especially CvARFs, may be key genes to control the morphological difference of ray florets. Simultaneously, MADS-box genes are involved in the co-regulation of ray floret morphogenesis. The results provide novel insights into the molecular mechanism of different petal type formation and lay a theoretical foundation for the directional breeding of petal type in chrysanthemums.

AB  - Plants display sophisticated mechanisms to tolerate challenging environmental conditions and need to manage their ontogenesis in parallel. Here, we set out to generate an RNA-Seq time series dataset throughout grapevine (grapes; Vitis vinifera) early bud development. The expression of the developmental regulator VviAP1 served as an indicator of the progression of development. We investigated the impact of changing temperatures on gene expression levels during the time series and detected a correlation between increased temperatures and a high expression level of genes encoding heat-shock proteins. The dataset also allowed the exemplary investigation of expression patterns of genes from three transcription factor (TF) gene families, namely MADS-box, WRKY, and R2R3-MYB genes. Inspection of the expression profiles from all three TF gene families indicated that a switch in the developmental program takes place in July which coincides with increased expression of the bud dormancy marker gene VviDRM1.

AB  - Transcriptomic and gene expression analysis have greatly facilitated the identification and characterization of transcriptional regulatory factors and effectors involved in dormancy progression and other physiological processes orchestrated during bud development in peach and other temperate fruit species. Gene expression measurements are most usually based on average values from several or many individual buds. We have performed single-bud gene analysis in flower buds of peach across dormancy release using amplicons from the master regulatory DORMANCY-ASSOCIATED MADS-BOX (DAM) factors, several jasmonic acid biosynthetic genes, other genes related to flowering development, cell growth resumption, and abiotic stress tolerance. This analysis provides a close view on gene-specific, single-bud variability throughout the developmental shift from dormant to dormancy-released stages, contributing to the characterization of putative co-expression modules and other regulatory aspects in this particular tissue.

AB  - In plants, MADS-box transcription factors are key regulators of floral and fruit development, organ dehiscence and stress responses. Nevertheless, the functions of most of them are still unknown. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the AGL17-like clade of MADS-box transcription factors comprises four members. AGL17 is involved in floral induction, whereas AGL44/ANR1 is involved in the adaptive development of roots in response to nitrate. AGL21 is primarily expressed in the roots and AGL16 in the leaves, suggesting that these transcription factors may be involved in the control of vegetative development. In Oryza sativa, the AGL17-like clade comprises five members, OsMADS23, OsMADS25, OsMADS27, OsMADS57 and OsMADS61. In a first attempt to characterize their functions, we used promoter::Gus reporter gene fusions and RT-qPCR to study the expression patterns of these genes and their regulation by different external stimuli. The OsMADS23, OsMADS25, OsMADS27 and OsMADS57 promoters were active in the root's central cylinder. In addition, the OsMADS57 promoter was active in leaves, whereas the OsMADS61 promoter was only active in the leaf tips and the stem base. OsMADS25 and OsMADS27 transcripts accumulated in response to osmotic stress, whereas the expression levels of OsMADS25, OsMADS27 and OsMADS57 were slightly induced by nitrate. Each of these five genes was responsive to various hormonal treatments. These distinct expression patterns indicate that these five genes have specific and non-redundant functions that likely differs from those of their A. thaliana homologs.

AB  - Flower development in angiosperms is controlled in part by floral homeotic genes, many of which are members of the plant MADS-box regulatory gene family. The evolutionary history of these developmental genes was reconstructed using 74 loci from 15 dicot, three monocot, and one conifer species. Molecular clock estimates suggest that the different floral homeotic gene lineages began to diverge from one another about 450-500 mya, around the time of the origin of land plants themselves.

AB  - Cineraria (Senecio cruentus) is an ornamental plant with pure colour and bicolour cultivars, widely used for landscaping. Anthocyanin biosynthesis influences coloration patterns in cineraria. However, how anthocyanins accumulate and distribute in cineraria is poorly understood. This study investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying anthocyanin biosynthesis and bicolour formation in cineraria using pure colour and bicolour cultivars. Transcriptome and gene expression analysis showed that five genes, ScCHS2, ScF3H1, ScDFR3, ScANS, and ScbHLH17, were inhibited in the white cultivar and colourless regions of bicolour cultivars. In contrast, two MADS-box genes, ScAG and ScAGL11, showed significantly higher expression in the colourless regions of bicolour cultivars. ScAG and ScAGL11 were localized in the nucleus and co-expressed with the bicolour trait. Further functional analysis verified that ScAG inhibits anthocyanin accumulation in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum). However, virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) experiments showed that silencing of ScAG and ScAGL11 increases anthocyanin content in cineraria leaves. Similar results were observed when ScAG and ScAGL11 were silenced in the cineraria capitulum, accompanied by the smaller size of the colourless region, specifically in the ScAG/ScAGL11-silenced plants. The expression of ScCHS2, ScDFR3, and ScF3H1 increased in silenced cineraria leaves and capitulum. Furthermore, yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation experiments demonstrated that ScAG interacts with ScAGL11. Moreover, ScAG directly inhibited the transcription of ScF3H1 while ScAGL11 inhibited ScDFR3 expression by binding to their promoters separately. The findings reported herein indicate that ScAG and ScAGL11 negatively regulate anthocyanin biosynthesis in cineraria ray florets, and their differential expression in ray florets influences the bicolour pattern appearance.

AB  - Alternative splicing and duplication provide the possibility of functional divergence of MADS-box genes. Compared with its Arabidopsis counterpart PI gene, Zmm16 in maize recruits a new role in carpel abortion and floral asymmetry, whereas the other two duplicated genes, Zmm18/29, have not yet been attributed to any function in flower development as a typical B class gene does. Here, alternatively spliced transcripts of three PI(L) genes were analyzed, among which we described the candidate functional isoforms and analyzed the potential effects of alternative splicing (AS) on protein-protein interactions as well, then their phylogenetic relationships with orthologs in typical grasses were further analyzed. Furthermore, we compared the cis-acting elements specific for three maize PI(L) genes, especially the elements related to methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and gibberellic acid (GA), both hormones involved in the sex-determination process in maize. Together with the results from the co-expression networks during reproductive organ development, we speculated that, due to duplication and alternative splicing, Zmm18/29 may play a role in GA- and MeJA-related developmental process. These results provide novel clues for experimental validation of the evolutional meaning of maize PI(L) genes.

AB  - MADS-box proteins have been implicated in many biological processes. However, plant MADS-box proteins functioning in floral organ abscission and the underlying physiological mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we report the identification and functional characterization of PsJOINTLESS isolated from 'Kuerlexiangli'. PsJOINTLESS had a complete open reading frame of 672bp, encoding a 224 amino acid peptide, and shared high sequence identities with MADS-box from other plants. PsJOINTLESS was subcellularly targeted to the nucleus, supporting its role as a transcription factor. Expression levels of PsJOINTLESS in the calyx tube were strongly induced by calyx abscission treatment at 6d after full bloom. Overexpression of PsJOINTLESS in tomato enhanced the rate of pedicel abscission rate. Of special note, the transgenic plants increased the abscission zone cell layer compared with wild type. Furthermore, the tomato transgenic lines showed thinner flower pedicels, more cell number and small pedicel cell size. The cellulase activity in pedicel abscission zone of transgenic plants was higher than that of wild type. In addition, steady-state mRNA levels of five cell wall hydrolase genes coding for either functional or regulatory proteins were induced to higher levels in the transgenic lines. These results clearly demonstrate that PsJOINTLESS may affect pedicel abscission zone development.

AB  - E-class MADS-box transcription factors, SEPALLATA (SEP) genes have an important role in fl oral organ initiation and development and fruit ripening. In this study, four sweet cherry SEP-like genes (PaMADS2, PaMADS4, PaMADS5, and PaMADS7) were cloned and functionally characterized. Gene expression analysis showed that the differential expression levels of PaMADS4 and PaMADS7 coincided with fruit ripening, and expression of PaMADS2 and PaMADS5 did not. Expression of PaMADS7 was affected by ABA and IAA. Subcellular localization assay demonstrated that four sweet cherry SEP-like proteins were all localized inside the nucleus. Silencing PaMADS7 using TRV-mediated virus-induced gene silencing inhibited fruit ripening and in fl uenced major ripening-related physiological processes, such as ABA content, soluble sugar contents, fruit firmness, and anthocyanin content, as well as expression of ripening-related genes. In addition, silencing of PaMADS7 induced phenotype defects that suppressed fruit ripening, which were rescued by exogenous ABA. Furthermore, yeast one-hybrid assay (Y1H) and transient expression analyses revealed that PaMADS7 directly binds to the promoter of PaPG1, which is involved in sweet cherry fruit softening, and positively activated PaPG1expression. These results showed that PaMADS7 is an indispensable positive regulator of sweet cherry fruit ripening and softening.

AB  - The MADS box transcription factor RIN is a global regulator of fruit ripening. However, the direct targets modulated by RIN and the mechanisms underlying the transcriptional regulation remain largely unknown. Here we identified 41 protein spots representing 35 individual genes as potential targets of RIN by comparative proteomic analysis of a rin mutant in tomato fruits. Gene expression analysis showed that the mRNA level of 26 genes correlated well with the protein level. After examining the promoter regions of the candidate genes, a variable number of RIN binding sites were found. Five genes (E8, TomloxC, PNAE, PGK and ADH2) were identified as novel direct targets of RIN by chromatin immunoprecipitation. The results of a gel mobility shift assay confirmed the direct binding of RIN to the promoters of these genes. Of the direct target genes, TomloxC and ADH2, which encode lipoxygenase (LOX) and alcohol dehydrogenase, respectively, are critical for the production of characteristic tomato aromas derived from LOX pathway. Further study indicated that RIN also directly regulates the expression of HPL, which encodes hydroperoxide lyase, another rate-limiting enzyme in the LOX pathway. Loss of function of RIN causes de-regulation of the LOX pathway, leading to a specific defect in the generation of aroma compounds derived from this pathway. These results indicate that RIN modulates aroma formation by direct and rigorous regulation of expression of genes in the LOX pathway. Taken together, our findings suggest that the regulatory effect of RIN on fruit ripening is achieved by targeting specific molecular pathways.

AB  - MADS-box is an important transcriptional regulatory element in plant growth. The MIKC-type MADS-box genes play important roles. However, the identification and evolutionary investigation of MIKC-type MADS-box family members in Rosaceae have been inadequate. Therefore, based on whole-genome data from Prunus dulcis, Prunus salicina, Prunus armeniaca, Prunus persica, Prunus mira, and Amygdalus nana, we depicted the evolution and divergence patterns of MIKC-type MADS-box family genes. In this study, we found 222 MIKC-type MADS-box genes from six Rosaceae species. These genes were classified into five clades, and only motif 1 was identified across all MIKC-type MADS-box proteins, except PdMADS42 and PmiMADS16. The structural properties of these genes significantly varied in sequence lengths between species, despite the high levels of similarity in exon lengths and numbers. MIKC-type MADS-box genes were found to have mostly been limited through purifying selection processes. Remarkably divergent regions were found inside the MIKC-type MADS-box genes’ domains, where clade III displayed more conserved activities and may have retained more original functions over the evolutionary process; clade I, on the other hand, may have undergone substantial functional limitations in a specific functional role. These findings provide the groundwork for future research into the molecular evolutionary processes of the plant MIKC-type MADS-box gene family.

AB  - MADS-box transcription factors (TFs) are present in nearly all major eukaryotic groups. They are divided into Type I and Type II that differ in domain structure, functional roles, and rates of evolution. In flowering plants, major evolutionary innovations like flowers, ovules, and fruits have been closely connected to Type II MADS-box TFs. The role of Type I MADS-box TFs in angiosperm evolution remains to be identified. Here, we show that the formation of angiosperm-specific Type I MADS-box clades of Mgamma and Mgamma-interacting Malpha genes (Malpha*) can be tracked back to the ancestor of all angiosperms. Angiosperm-specific Mgamma and Malpha* genes were preferentially expressed in the endosperm, consistent with their proposed function as heterodimers in the angiosperm-specific embryo nourishing endosperm tissue. We propose that duplication and diversification of Type I MADS genes underpin the evolution of the endosperm, a developmental innovation closely connected to the origin and success of angiosperms.

AB  - MADS-box transcription factors (TFs), among the first TFs extensively studied, exhibit a wide distribution across eukaryotes and play diverse functional roles. Varying by domain architecture, MADS-box TFs in land plants are categorized into Type I (M-type) and Type II (MIKC-type). Type I and II genes have been considered orthologous to the SRF and MEF2 genes in animals, respectively, presumably originating from a duplication before the divergence of eukaryotes. Here, we exploited the increasing availability of eukaryotic MADS-box sequences and reassessed their evolution. While supporting the ancient duplication giving rise to SRF- and MEF2-types, we found that Type I and II genes originated from the MEF2-type genes through another duplication in the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of land plants. Protein structures predicted by AlphaFold2 and OmegaFold support our phylogenetic analyses, with plant Type I and II TFs resembling the MEF2-type structure, rather than SRFs. We hypothesize that the ancestral SRF-type TFs were lost in the MRCA of Archaeplastida (the kingdom Plantae sensu lato). The retained MEF2-type TFs acquired a Keratin-like domain and became MIKC-type before the divergence of Streptophyta. Subsequently in the MRCA of land plants, M-type TFs evolved from a duplicated MIKC-type precursor through loss of the Keratin-like domain, leading to the Type I clade. Both Type I and II TFs expanded and functionally differentiated in concert with the increasing complexity of land plant body architecture. The recruitment of these originally stress-responsive TFs into developmental programs, including those underlying reproduction, may have facilitated the adaptation to the terrestrial environment.

AB  - In this study, a MADS-box gene (BpMADS), which is an ortholog of AP1 from Arabidopsis, was isolated from birch (Betula platyphylla). Transgenic Arabidopsis containing a BpMADS promoter::GUS construct was produced, which exhibited strong GUS staining in sepal tissues. Ectopic expression of BpMADS significantly enhanced the flowering of tobacco (35S::BpMADS). In addition, the chloroplasts of transgenic tobacco exhibited much higher growth and division rates, as well rates of photosynthesis, than wild-type. A grafting experiment demonstrated that the flowering time of the scion was not affected by stock that overexpressed BpMADS. In addition, the overexpression of BpMADS resulted in the upregulation of some flowering-related genes in tobacco.

AB  - MADS-box proteins, a well-conserved family of transcription factors in eukaryotic organisms, specifically regulate a wide range of cellular functions, including primary metabolism, cell cycle, and cell identity. However, little is known about roles of the MADS-box protein family in the fungal pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. In this research, the S. sclerotiorum MADS-box gene SsMADS was cloned; it encodes a protein that is highly similar to Mcm1 orthologs from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and other fungi, and includes a highly conserved DNA-binding domain. MADS is a member of the MADS box protein SRF (serum response factor) lineage. SsMADS function was investigated using RNA interference. Silenced strains were obtained using genetic transformation of the RNA interference vectors pS1-SsMADS and pSD-SsMADS. SsMADS expression levels in silenced strains were analyzed using RT-PCR. The results showed that SsMADS mRNA expression in these silenced strains was reduced to different degrees, and growth rate in these silenced strains was significantly decreased. Infecting tomato leaflets with silenced strains indicated that SsMADS was required for leaf pathogenesis in a susceptible host. Our results suggest that the MADS-box transcription factor SsMADS is involved in S. sclerotiorum growth and virulence.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bud dormancy is a phenological adaptation of temperate perennials that ensures survival under winter temperature conditions by ceasing growth and increasing cold hardiness. SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP)-like factors, and particularly a subset of them named DORMANCY-ASSOCIATED MADS-BOX (DAM), are master regulators of bud dormancy in perennials, prominently Rosaceae crops widely adapted to varying environmental conditions. RESULTS: SVP-like proteins from recently sequenced Rosaceae genomes were identified and characterized using sequence, phylogenetic and synteny analysis tools. SVP-like proteins clustered in three clades (SVP1-3), with known DAM proteins located within SVP2 clade, which also included Arabidopsis AGAMOUS-LIKE 24 (AthAGL24). A more detailed study on these protein sequences led to the identification of a 15-amino acid long motif specific to DAM proteins, which affected protein heteromerization properties by yeast two-hybrid system in peach PpeDAM6, and the unexpected finding of predicted DAM-like genes in loquat, an evergreen species lacking winter dormancy. DAM gene expression in loquat trees was studied by quantitative PCR, associating with inflorescence development and growth in varieties with contrasting flowering behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: Phylogenetic, synteny analyses and heterologous overexpression in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana supported three major conclusions: 1) DAM proteins might have emerged from the SVP2 clade in the Amygdaloideae subfamily of Rosaceae; 2) a short DAM-specific motif affects protein heteromerization, with a likely effect on DAM transcriptional targets and other functional features, providing a sequence signature for the DAM group of dormancy factors; 3) in agreement with other recent studies, DAM associates with inflorescence development and growth, independently of the dormancy habit.

AB  - Plant growth regulators (PGR) are essential for somatic embryogenesis (SE) in different species, and Coffea canephora is no exception. In our study model, previously, we have been able to elucidate the participation of various genes involved in SE by using different strategies; however, until now, we have not used a proteomic approach. This research seeks to contribute to understanding the primary cellular pathways involved in developing SE in C. canephora. The process of our model consists of two stages: (1) preconditioning in MS medium with auxin (NAA) and cytokinin (KIN), and (2) induction in Yasuda liquid medium added with cytokinin (BA). Therefore, in this study, we analyzed different days of the SE induction process using shotgun label-free proteomics. An amount of 1630 proteins was found among different sampling days of the process, of which the majority were accumulated during the induction stage. We found that some of the most enriched pathways during this process were the biosynthesis of amino acids and secondary metabolites. Eighteen proteins were found related to auxin homeostasis and two to cytokinin metabolism, such as ABC, BIG, ILR, LOG, and ARR. Ten proteins and transcription factors related to SE were also identified, like SERK1, SKP1, nuclear transcription factor Y, MADS-box, and calreticulin, and 19 related to other processes of plant development, among which the 14-3-3 and PP2A proteins stand out. This is the first report on the proteomic approach to elucidate the mechanisms that operate during the induction of SE in C. canephora. So, our findings provide the groundwork for future, more in-depth research. Data are available via ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD047172.

AB  - A well-developed root system benefits host plants by optimizing water absorption and nutrient uptake and thereby increases plant productivity. In this study we have characterized the root transcriptome using RNA-seq and subsequential functional analysis in a set of drought tolerant and susceptible genotypes. The goal of the study was to elucidate and characterize water deficit-responsive genes in wheat landraces that had been through long-term field and biochemical screening for drought tolerance. The results confirm genotype differences in water-deficit tolerance in line with earlier results from field trials. The transcriptomics survey highlighted a total of 14,187 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that responded to water deficit. The characterization of these genes shows that all chromosomes contribute to water-deficit tolerance, but to different degrees, and the B genome showed higher involvement than the A and D genomes. The DEGs were mainly mapped to flavonoid, phenylpropanoid, and diterpenoid biosynthesis pathways, as well as glutathione metabolism and hormone signaling. Furthermore, extracellular region, apoplast, cell periphery, and external encapsulating structure were the main water deficit-responsive cellular components in roots. A total of 1,377 DEGs were also predicted to function as transcription factors (TFs) from different families regulating downstream cascades. TFs from the AP2/ERF-ERF, MYB-related, B3, WRKY, Tify, and NAC families were the main genotype-specific regulatory factors. To further characterize the dynamic biosynthetic pathways, protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed using significant KEGG proteins and putative TFs. In PPIs, enzymes from the CYP450, TaABA8OH2, PAL, and GST families play important roles in water-deficit tolerance in connection with MYB13-1, MADS-box, and NAC transcription factors.

AB  - Reduced expression of MADS-box gene AGAMOUS-LIKE11 (VviAGL11) is responsible for stenospermocarpic seedlessness in bunch grapes. This study is aimed to characterize the VviAGL11 orthologous gene (VroAGL11) in native muscadine grapes (Vitis rotundifolia) at the molecular level and analyze its divergence from other plants. The VroAGL11 transcripts were found in all muscadine cultivars tested and highly expressed in berries while barely detectable in leaves. RT-PCR and sequencing of predicted ORFs from diverse grape species showed that AGL11 transcripts were conservatively spliced. The encoded VroAGL11 protein contains highly conserved MADS-MEF2-like domain, MADS domain, K box, putative phosphorylation site and two sumoylation motifs. The muscadine VroAGL11 proteins are almost identical (99%) to that of seeded bunch cultivar, Chardonnay, except in one amino acid (A79G), but differs from mutant protein of seedless bunch grape, Sultanina, in two amino acids, R197L and T210A. Phylogenetic analysis showed that AGL11 gene of muscadine and other Vitis species formed a separate clade than that of other eudicots and monocots. Muscadine grape cultivar "Jane Bell" containing the highest percentage of seed content in berry (7.2% of berry weight) had the highest VroAGL11 expression, but almost none to nominal expression in seedless cultivars Fry Seedless (muscadine) and Reliance Seedless (bunch). These findings suggest that VroAGL11 gene controls the seed morphogenesis in muscadine grapes like in bunch grape and can be manipulated to induce stenospermocarpic seedlessness using gene editing technology.

AB  - Rafflesia, a holoparasitic genus that produces the largest flower in the world is characterized by the absence of leaves, stem and other macroscopic organs. To better understand the molecular regulation of flower development in this genus we isolated and characterized a floral MADS-box gene, namely, RcMADS1 from Rafflesia cantleyi. Heterologous expression analysis in Arabidopsis was chosen because Rafflesia is not amenable to genetic manipulations. RcMADS1 shares sequence similarity with AGAMOUS-LIKE 24 (AGL24) and SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) of Arabidopsis. Ectopic expression of RcMADS1 in Arabidopsis caused early flowering and conversion of sepals and petals into leaf-like structures, and carpels into inflorescences. In 35S::RcMADS1 plants SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 (SOC1), a downstream target gene of AGL24, was upregulated. 35S::RcMADS1 plants exhibit early flowering and conversion of the floral meristem into inflorescence meristem, as in 35S::AGL24 plants. Similar to AGL24, RcMADS1 could rescue the late flowering phenotypes of agl24-1 and FRIGIDA, but not the early flowering of svp-41. Based on these results, we propose that RcMADS1 is a functional ortholog of Arabidopsis AGL24.

AB  - In angiosperms the reproductive transition results in the transformation of a vegetative apical meristem (SAM) into an inflorescence meristem (IM), capable of forming floral meristems (FM). Two key players in the flowering transition are AGAMOUS-like 24 (AGL24) and SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP). They are eudicot MADS-box paralogs performing opposite roles, as AGL24 positively regulates flowering while SVP represses the reproductive transition in Arabidopsis. We confirm that the Arabidopsis functional reference cannot be readily extrapolated to all eudicots as there are additional duplications of AGL24 in early divergent eudicots and core eudicots with significant sequence variation. In addition, we found that in monocots, two additional independent duplication events have resulted in at least three clades of AGL24/SVP homologs, some only found in Orchidaceae. Protein sequence analyses and comparative evolutionary rates point to higher rates of relaxed negative selection in the Core Eudicot AGL24 B and the Orch SVP-like B clades, in eudicots and monocots respectively. On the other hand, expression data points to plesiomorphic pleiotropic roles of AGL24/SVP genes likely similar to SVP core eudicot genes, and the acquisition of new roles as flowering positive regulators in Core Eudicot AGL24 A genes. Our research presents evidence on the diversification and recruitment of AGL24/SVP homologs in flowering transition in orchids. Although, broad expression of most copies does not allow to determine if they act as flowering repressors or promoters, the restricted expression of some homologs in the SAM suggests putative roles in maintaining the vegetative phase. If so studying in detail the function of AGL24/SVP homologs in orchids is critical to identify putative flowering repressors in a lineage where other canonical repressors remain elusive.

AB  - Pollen development and its germination are obligatory for the reproductive success of flowering plants. Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CPKs, also known as CDPKs) regulate diverse signaling pathways controlling plant growth and development. Here, we report the functional characterization of a novel OsCPK29 from rice, which is mainly expressed during pollen maturation stages of the anther. OsCPK29 exclusively localizes in the nucleus, and its N-terminal variable domain is responsible for retaining it in the nucleus. OsCPK29 knockdown rice plants exhibit reduced fertility, set fewer seeds, and produce collapsed non-viable pollen grains that do not germinate. Cytological analysis of anther semi-thin sections during different developmental stages suggested that pollen abnormalities appear after the vacuolated pollen stage. Detailed microscopic study of pollen grains further revealed that they were lacking the functional intine layer although exine layer was present. Consistent with that, downregulation of known intine development-related rice genes was also observed in OsCPK29 silenced anthers. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that OsCPK29 interacts in vitro as well as in vivo with the MADS68 transcription factor which is a known regulator of pollen development. Therefore, phenotypic observations and molecular studies suggest that OsCPK29 is an important regulator of pollen development in rice.

AB  - Since their introduction in Europe, pumpkins (Cucurbita maxima Duch.) have rapidly dispersed throughout the world. This is mainly because of their wide genetic diversity and Plasticity to thrive in a wide range of geographical regions across the world, their high nutritional value and suitability to integrate with local cuisines, and their long shelf life. Competition for growing the showy type or mammoth-sized pumpkins that produce the largest fruit of the entire plant kingdom has drawn attention. In this study, we used genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms to resolve admixture among different pumpkin groups. Also, to resolve population differentiation, genome-wide divergence and evolutionary forces underlying the evolution of mammoth-sized pumpkin. The admixture analysis indicates that the mammoth group (also called Display or Giant) evolved from the hubbard group with genome-wide introgressions from the buttercup group. We archived a set of private alleles underlying fruit development in mammoth group, and resolved haplotype level divergence involved in the evolutionary mechanisms. Our genome-wide association study identified three major allelic effects underlying various fruit-size genes in this study. For fruit weight, a missense variant in the homeobox-leucine zipper protein ATHB-20-like (S04_18528409) was significantly associated (false discovery rate = 0.000004) with fruit weight, while high allelic effect was consistent across the 3 years of the study. A cofactor (S08_217549) on chromosome 8 is strongly associated with fruit length, having superior allelic effect across the 3 years of this study. A missense variant (S10_4639871) on translocation protein SEC62 is a cofactor for fruit diameter. Several known molecular mechanisms are likely controlling giant fruit size, including endoreduplication, hormonal regulation, CLV-WUS signaling pathway, MADS-box family, and ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This study provides a general framework for the evolutionary relationship among horticulture groups of C. maxima and elucidates the origins of rare variants contributing to the giant pumpkin fruit size.

AB  - AGAMOUS-like6 (AGL6) genes encode MIKC-type MADS box transcription factors and are closely related to SEPALLATA and AP1/FUL-like genes. Here, we focus on the molecular evolution and expression of the AGL6-like genes in grasses. We have found that AGL6-like genes are expressed in ovules, lodicules (second whorl floral organs), paleas (putative first whorl floral organs), and floral meristems. Each of these expression domains was acquired at a different time in evolution, indicating that each represents a distinct function of the gene product and that the AGL6-like genes are pleiotropic. Expression in the inner integument of the ovule appears to be an ancient expression pattern corresponding to the expression of the gene in the megasporangium and integument in gymnosperms. Expression in floral meristems appears to have been acquired in the angiosperms and expression in second whorl organs in monocots. Early in grass evolution, AGL6-like orthologs acquired a new expression domain in the palea. Stamen expression is variable. Most grasses have a single AGL6-like gene (orthologous to the rice [Oryza sativa] gene MADS6). However, rice and other species of Oryza have a second copy (orthologous to rice MADS17) that appears to be the result of an ancient duplication.

AB  - Adonis amurensis is a perennial herbaceous flower that blooms in early spring in northeast China, where the night temperature can drop to -15 degrees C. To understand flowering time regulation and floral organogenesis of A. amurensis, the MIKC(c)-type MADS (Mcm1/Agamous/ Deficiens/Srf)-box genes were identified and characterized from the transcriptomes of the flower organs. In this study, 43 non-redundant MADS-box genes (38 MIKC(c), 3 MIKC*, and 2 Malpha) were identified. Phylogenetic and conserved motif analysis divided the 38 MIKC(c)-type genes into three major classes: ABCDE model (including AP1/FUL, AP3/PI, AG, STK, and SEPs/AGL6), suppressor of overexpression of constans1 (SOC1), and short vegetative phase (SVP). qPCR analysis showed that the ABCDE model genes were highly expressed mainly in flowers and differentially expressed in the different tissues of flower organs, suggesting that they may be involved in the flower organ identity of A. amurensis. Subcellular localization revealed that 17 full-length MADSs were mainly localized in the nucleus: in Arabidopsis, the heterologous expression of three full-length SOC1-type genes caused early flowering and altered the expression of endogenous flowering time genes. Our analyses provide an overall insight into MIKC(c) genes in A. amurensis and their potential roles in floral organogenesis and flowering time regulation.

AB  - Upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) is a salt-tolerant crop that can withstand high salinity levels without showing signs of harm to the plant. However, the plant is more prone to salinity stress at the germination stage and a poor germination as well as poor crop stand lead to a weak productivity. It is possible to obtain a comprehensive picture of the cotton seedling germination and establishment against salt stress by examining dynamic changes in the transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles. The reported study employed a pretreatment of cotton seeds by soaking them in 0.2% Magnesium Sulphate (MgSO(4)) solution at room temperature for 4, 8, and 12 h. The analysis of variance based on the studied traits emergence rate, above and underground plant parts' fresh weight measured, displayed significant differences of the three treatments compared with the control. A total of 28,801 and 264 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) were discovered to code for biological processes such as response to salt stress, cellular response to salt stress, abscisic acid receptor PYR/PYL, regulation of seed growth and germination, and auxin-activated signaling pathways. A large amount of ethylene-responsive transcription factors (ERF) was identified (1235) as differentially expressed, followed by bHLH (252), WRKY (96), MYB (202), GATA (81), RABA (64), DIVARICATA (28), and MADs-box (26) in treated seedling samples. Functional enrichment analysis revealed the significant roles in the hormones and signal transduction, carbohydrates metabolism, and biosynthesis of amino acids, promoting salt stress tolerance. Our results indicated positive effects of MgSO(4) at 4 h treatment on seedling germination and growth, seemingly by activating certain growth-regulating enzymes (auxins, gibberellins, jasmonates, abscisic acid, and salicylic acid) and metabolites (phenolic acids, flavonoids, and akaloids). Such pretreatment of MgSO(4) on seeds would be beneficial in future cotton management under saline conditions to enhance good crop stand and productivity.

AB  - Integration of environmental and endogenous cues at plant shoot meristems determines the timing of flowering and reproductive development. The MADS box transcription factor FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) of Arabidopsis thaliana is an important repressor of floral transition, which blocks flowering until plants are exposed to winter cold. However, the target genes of FLC have not been thoroughly described, and our understanding of the mechanisms by which FLC represses transcription of these targets and how this repression is overcome during floral transition is still fragmentary. Here, we identify and characterize TARGET OF FLC AND SVP1 (TFS1), a novel target gene of FLC and its interacting protein SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP). TFS1 encodes a B3-type transcription factor, and we show that tfs1 mutants are later flowering than wild-type, particularly under short days. FLC and SVP repress TFS1 transcription leading to deposition of trimethylation of Iysine 27 of histone 3 (H3K27me3) by the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 at the TFS1 locus. During floral transition, after downregulation of FLC by cold, TFS1 transcription is promoted by SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS1 (SOC1), a MADS box protein encoded by another target of FLC/SVP. SOC1 opposes PRC function at TFS1 through recruitment of the histone demethylase RELATIVE OF EARLY FLOWERING 6 (REF6) and the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeler ATPase BRAHMA (BRM). This recruitment of BRM is also strictly required for SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE 9 (SPL9) binding at TFS1 to coordinate RNAPII recruitment through the Mediator complex. Thus, we show that antagonistic chromatin modifications mediated by different MADS box transcription factor complexes play a crucial role in defining the temporal and spatial patterns of transcription of genes within a network of interactions downstream of FLC/SVP during floral transition.

AB  - Antirrhinum majus DEFICIENS (DEF) and Arabidopsis thaliana APETALA3 (AP3) MADS box proteins are required to specify petal and stamen identity. Sampling of DEF/AP3 homologs revealed two types of DEF/AP3 proteins, euAP3 and TOMATO MADS BOX GENE6 (TM6), within core eudicots, and we show functional divergence in Petunia hybrida euAP3 and TM6 proteins. Petunia DEF (also known as GREEN PETALS [GP]) is expressed mainly in whorls 2 and 3, and its expression pattern remains unchanged in a blind (bl) mutant background, in which the cadastral C-repression function in the perianth is impaired. Petunia TM6 functions as a B-class organ identity protein only in the determination of stamen identity. Atypically, Petunia TM6 is regulated like a C-class rather than a B-class gene, is expressed mainly in whorls 3 and 4, and is repressed by BL in the perianth, thereby preventing involvement in petal development. A promoter comparison between DEF and TM6 indicates an important change in regulatory elements during or after the duplication that resulted in euAP3- and TM6-type genes. Surprisingly, although TM6 normally is not involved in petal development, 35S-driven TM6 expression can restore petal development in a def (gp) mutant background. Finally, we isolated both euAP3 and TM6 genes from seven solanaceous species, suggesting that a dual euAP3/TM6 B-function system might be the rule in the Solanaceae.

AB  - Release of bud dormancy in perennial plants resembles vernalization in Arabidopsis thaliana and cereals. In both cases, a certain period of chilling is required for accomplishing the reproductive phase, and several transcription factors with the MADS-box domain perform a central regulatory role in these processes. The expression of DORMANCY-ASSOCIATED MADS-box (DAM)-related genes has been found to be up-regulated in dormant buds of numerous plant species, such as poplar, raspberry, leafy spurge, blackcurrant, Japanese apricot, and peach. Moreover, functional evidence suggests the involvement of DAM genes in the regulation of seasonal dormancy in peach. Recent findings highlight the presence of genome-wide epigenetic modifications related to dormancy events, and more specifically the epigenetic regulation of DAM-related genes in a similar way to FLOWERING LOCUS C, a key integrator of vernalization effectors on flowering initiation in Arabidopsis. We revise the most relevant molecular and genomic contributions in the field of bud dormancy, and discuss the increasing evidence for chromatin modification involvement in the epigenetic regulation of seasonal dormancy cycles in perennial plants.

AB  - FLC is a MADS box transcription factor that acts as a dosage-dependent repressor of flowering. We carried out a 2D gel analysis and showed that the majority of endogenous FLC and overexpressed FLC-FLAG proteins are post-translationally modified. The endogenous and transgenic proteins have different floral repressor activities; however, they have similar, if not the same, profiles of post-translational modifications. The protein modification profile was also not changed by vernalization treatment. The activities of other MADS box proteins have been shown to be affected by phosphorylation and we found that both the endogenous FLC and the transgenic FLC-FLAG protein are phosphorylated. When eight potential serine kinase target sites in FLC were changed to mimic phosphorylated residues, expression of the mutant FLC-FLAG protein led to early flowering, suggesting that the repressive function was abolished. When the same eight serine residues were changed to non-phosphorylatable residues, expression of the resulting protein gave the same weak flowering repression as overexpressed unmodified FLC-FLAG. The non-phosphorylatable variant of FLC-FLAG showed a similar spectrum of post-translational modifications to unmodified FLC-FLAG, indicating that modifications other than the predicted phosphorylations occur. Our data provide evidence for a post-translational regulation of FLC function.

AB  - Ovules are essential for sexual plant reproduction and seed formation, and are fundamental for agriculture. However, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing ovule development is far from complete. In Arabidopsis, ovule identity is determined by homeotic MADS-domain proteins that define the floral C- (AG) and D- (SHP1/SHP2, STK) functions. Pre-mRNA processing of these genes is critical and mediated by HUA-PEP activity, composed of genes encoding RNA-binding proteins. In strong hua-pep mutants, functional transcripts for C- and D-function genes are reduced, resulting in homeotic transformation of ovules. Thus, hua-pep mutants provide an unique sensitized background to study ovule morphogenesis when C- and D-functions are simultaneously compromised. We found that hua-pep ovules are morphologically sepaloid and show ectopic expression of the homeotic class-A gene AP1. Inactivation of AP1 or AP2 (A-function genes) in hua-pep mutants reduced homeotic conversions, rescuing ovule identity while promoting carpelloid traits in transformed ovules. Interestingly, increased AG dosage led to similar results. Our findings strongly suggest that HUA-PEP activity is required for correct C and D floral functions, which in turn prevents ectopic expression of class-A genes in ovules for their proper morphogenesis, evoking the classic A-C antagonism of the ABC model for floral organ development.

AB  - Changes in transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) can alter the spatiotemporal expression pattern and transcript abundance of genes. Loss and gain of TFBSs were shown to cause shifts in expression patterns in numerous cases. However, we know little about the evolution of extended regulatory sequences incorporating many TFBSs. We compare, across the crucifers (Brassicaceae, cabbage family), the sequences between the translated regions of Arabidopsis Bsister (ABS)-like MADS-box genes (including paralogous GOA-like genes) and the next gene upstream, as an example of family-wide evolution of putative upstream regulatory regions (PURRs). ABS-like genes are essential for integument development of ovules and endothelium formation in seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana. A combination of motif-based gene ontology enrichment and reporter gene analysis using A. thaliana as common trans-regulatory environment allows analysis of selected Brassicaceae Bsister gene PURRs. Comparison of TFBS of transcriptionally active ABS-like genes with those of transcriptionally largely inactive GOA-like genes shows that the number of in silico predicted TFBS) is similar between paralogs, emphasizing the importance of experimental verification for in silico characterization of TFBS activity and analysis of their evolution. Further, our data show highly conserved expression of Brassicaceae ABS-like genes almost exclusively in the chalazal region of ovules. The Arabidopsis-specific insertion of a transposable element (TE) into the ABS PURRs is required for stabilizing this spatially restricted expression, while other Brassicaceae achieve chalaza-specific expression without TE insertion. We hypothesize that the chalaza-specific expression of ABS is regulated by cis-regulatory elements provided by the TE.

AB  - Abscission is the mechanism by which plants disconnect unfertilized flowers, ripe fruits, senescent or diseased organs from the plant. In tomato, pedicel abscission is an important agronomic factor that controls yield and post-harvest fruit quality. Two non-allelic mutations, jointless (j) and jointless-2 (j-2), controlling pedicel abscission zone formation have been documented but only j-2 has been extensively used in breeding. J was shown to encode a MADS-box protein. Using a combination of physical mapping and gene expression analysis we identified a positional candidate, Solyc12g038510, associated with j-2 phenotype. Targeted knockout of Solyc12g038510, using CRISPR/Cas9 system, validated our hypothesis. Solyc12g038510 encodes the MADS-box protein SlMBP21. Molecular analysis of j-2 natural variation revealed two independent loss-of-function mutants. The first results of an insertion of a Rider retrotransposable element. The second results of a stop codon mutation that leads to a truncated protein form. To bring new insights into the role of J and J-2 in abscission zone formation, we phenotyped the single and the double mutants and the engineered alleles. We showed that J is epistatic to J-2 and that the branched inflorescences and the leafy sepals observed in accessions harboring j-2 alleles are likely the consequences of linkage drags.

AB  - Potato MADS box 1 (POTM1) is a member of the SQUAMOSA-like family of plant MADS box genes isolated from an early stage tuber cDNA library. The RNA of POTM1 is most abundant in vegetative meristems of potato (Solanum tuberosum), accumulating specifically in the tunica and corpus layers of the meristem, the procambium, the lamina of new leaves, and newly formed axillary meristems. Transgenic lines with reduced levels of POTM1 mRNA exhibited decreased apical dominance accompanied by a compact growth habit and a reduction in leaf size. Suppression lines produced truncated shoot clusters from stem buds and, in a model system, exhibited enhanced axillary bud growth instead of producing a tuber. This enhanced axillary bud growth was not the result of increased axillary bud formation. Tuber yields were reduced and rooting of cuttings was strongly inhibited in POTM1 suppression lines. Both starch accumulation and the activation of cell division occurred in specific regions of the vegetative meristems of the POTM1 transgenic lines. Cytokinin levels in axillary buds of a transgenic suppression line increased 2- to 3-fold. These results imply that POTM1 mediates the control of axillary bud development by regulating cell growth in vegetative meristems.

AB  - The MADS-AFFECTING FLOWERING 2 (MAF2) gene of Arabidopsis thaliana has been characterized as a repressor of flowering. The molecular basis of MAF2 gene function and role of alternative MAF2 transcripts in flowering time modulation is not understood. MAF2 splice variant expression was quantified in cold-acclimated plants by quantitative RT-PCR. Cold influenced the abundance of splice variants and prompted a functional study of splice forms. Individual variants were overexpressed in the Col background and were assayed for their ability to delay flowering. Overexpression of MAF2 variants 2 and 4 had limited effect on flowering time. Overexpression of MAF2 splice variant 1 resulted in early flowering and affected the expression of the endogenous MAF2 gene and its paralogues, confounding functional assessment. In the Ll-2 Arabidopsis accession, a MAF2, MAF3, MAF4 and FLC null line, MAF2 var1 was consistent in its effect on reproductive delay under ambient and reduced temperatures, indicating that it acts as a repressor of flowering.

AB  - Seed development in flowering plants is initiated after a double fertilization event leading to the formation of zygotic embryo and endosperm tissues surrounded by the maternally derived seed coat. Although the seed coat does not take part in the fertilization process it develops immediately after fertilization, implicating a signaling mechanism from zygotic tissues to the surrounding maternal tissues. We addressed the question of the underlying mechanisms repressing seed coat development before fertilization and initiating seed coat development after fertilization by analyzing combinations of mutants that initiate seed development in the absence of fertilization. We discovered that seed coat development is actively repressed before fertilization by dosage-sensitive Polycomb group proteins acting in maternal tissues surrounding the female gametophyte. This repression is relieved after fertilization by a signal that is formed by the sexual endosperm. Fertilization is required for signal formation, as asexually formed endosperm fails to effectively initiate seed coat development in mutants with uncompromised maternal Polycomb group function. Mutants for the MADS-box transcription factor AGL62 initiate embryo and endosperm formation but fail to develop a seed coat, implicating AGL62 expression in the endosperm as a requirement for signal initiation. Together, our results provide evidence that fertilization of the central cell generates a signal that relieves Polycomb group-mediated repression in the surrounding maternal tissues to initiate seed coat formation.

AB  - Parental imbalances in the endosperm leading to impaired development and eventual hybrid seed failure are common causes of postzygotic isolation in flowering plants. Endosperm sensitivity to parental dosage is reflected by canonical phenotypes of "parental excess" in reciprocal interploid crosses. Moreover, parental-excess traits are also evident in many homoploid interspecific crosses, potentially reflecting among-lineage variation in "effective ploidy" driven by endosperm properties. However, the genetic basis of effective ploidy is unknown and genome-wide expression perturbations in parental-excess endosperms from homoploid crosses have yet to be reported. The tomato clade (Solanum section Lycopersicon), encompassing closely related diploids with partial-to-complete hybrid seed failure, provides outstanding opportunities to study these issues. Here, we compared replicated endosperm transcriptomes from six crosses within and among three wild tomato lineages. Strikingly, strongly inviable hybrid crosses displayed conspicuous, asymmetric expression perturbations that mirror previously characterized parental-excess phenotypes. Solanum peruvianum, the species inferred to have evolved higher effective ploidy than the other two, drove expression landscape polarization between maternal and paternal roles. This global expression divergence was mirrored in functionally important gene families such as MADS-box transcription factors and E3 ubiquitin ligases, and revealed differences in cell cycle tuning that match phenotypic differences in developing endosperm and mature seed size between reciprocal crosses. Our work starts to uncover the complex interactions between expression divergence, parental conflict, and hybrid seed failure that likely contributed to plant diversity.

AB  - Epigenetic modifications can yield information about connections between genotype, phenotype variation and environmental conditions. Bud dormancy release in temperate perennial fruit trees depends on internal and environmental signals such as cold accumulation and photoperiod. Previous investigations have noted the participation of epigenetic mechanisms in the control of this physiological process. We examined whether epigenetic modifications were modulated in MADS-box genes, potential candidates for the regulation of bud dormancy and flowering in sweet cherry (Prunus avium L.). We identified and cloned two MADS-box genes homologous to the already-characterized dormancy regulators DORMANCY-ASSOCIATED MADS-box (DAM3 and DAM5) from Prunus persica (L.) Batsch. Bisulfite sequencing of the identified genes (PavMADS1 and PavMADS2), Methylated DNA Immunoprecipitation and small RNA deep sequencing were performed to analyze the presence of DNA methylations that could be guided by non-coding RNAs in the floral buds exposed to differential chilling hours. The results obtained reveal an increase in the level of DNA methylation and abundance of matching small interference RNAs (siRNAs) in the promoter of PavMADS1 when the chilling requirement is complete. For the first intron and 5' UTR of PavMADS1, de novo DNA methylation could be associated with the increase in the abundance of 24-nt siRNA matching the promoter area. Also, in the second large intron of PavMADS1, maintenance DNA methylation in all cytosine contexts is associated with the presence of homologous siRNAs in that zone. For PavMADS2, only maintenance methylation was present in the CG context, and no matching siRNAs were detected. Silencing of PavMADS1 and PavMADS2 coincided with an increase in Flowering Locus T expression during dormancy. In conclusion, DNA methylations and siRNAs appear to be involved in the silencing of PavMADS1 during cold accumulation and dormancy release in sweet cherry.

AB  - Members of the MADS box gene family play important roles in flower development from the early step of determining the identity of floral meristems to specifying the identity of floral organ primordia later in flower development. We describe here the isolation and characterization of six additional members of this family, increasing the number of reported Arabidopsis MADS box genes to 17. All 11 members reported prior to this study are expressed in flowers, and the majority of them are floral specific. RNA expression analyses of the six genes reported here indicate that two genes, AGL11 and AGL13 (AGL for AGAMOUS-like), are preferentially expressed in ovules, but each has a distinct expression pattern. AGL15 is preferentially expressed in embryos, with its onset at or before the octant stage early in embryo development. AGL12, AGL14, and AGL17 are all preferentially expressed in root tissues and therefore represent the only characterized MADS box genes expressed in roots. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the two genes expressed in ovules are closely related to previously isolated MADS box genes, whereas the four genes showing nonfloral expression are more distantly related. Data from this and previous studies indicate that in addition to their proven role in flower development, MADS box genes are likely to play roles in many other aspects of plant development.

AB  - The MADS-box family of genes has been shown to play a significant role in the development of reproductive organs, including dry and fleshy fruits. In this study, the molecular properties of an AGAMOUS like MADS box transcription factor in banana cultivar Giant governor (Musa sp, AAA group, subgroup Cavendish) has been elucidated. We have detected a CArG-box sequence binding AGAMOUS MADS-box protein in banana flower and fruit nuclear extracts in DNA-protein interaction assays. The protein fraction in the DNA-protein complex was analyzed by mass spectrometry and using this information we have obtained the full length cDNA of the corresponding protein. The deduced protein sequence showed ~95% amino acid sequence homology with MA-MADS5, a MADS-box protein described previously from banana. We have characterized the domains of the identified AGAMOUS MADS-box protein involved in DNA binding and homodimer formation in vitro using full-length and truncated versions of affinity purified recombinant proteins. Furthermore, in order to gain insight about how DNA bending is achieved by this MADS-box factor, we performed circular permutation and phasing analysis using the wild type recombinant protein. The AGAMOUS MADS-box protein identified in this study has been found to predominantly accumulate in the climacteric fruit pulp and also in female flower ovary. In vivo and in vitro assays have revealed specific binding of the identified AGAMOUS MADS-box protein to CArG-box sequence in the promoters of major ripening genes in banana fruit. Overall, the expression patterns of this MADS-box protein in banana female flower ovary and during various phases of fruit ripening along with the interaction of the protein to the CArG-box sequence in the promoters of major ripening genes lead to interesting assumption about the possible involvement of this AGAMOUS MADS-box factor in banana fruit ripening and floral reproductive organ development.

AB  - Seedlessness is greatly prized by consumers of fresh grapes. While stenospermocarpic seed abortion determined by the SEED DEVELOPMENT INHIBITOR (SDI) locus is the usual source of seedlessness in commercial grapevine (Vitis vinifera) cultivars, the underlying sdi mutation remains unknown. Here, we undertook an integrative approach to identify the causal mutation. Quantitative genetics and fine-mapping in two 'Crimson Seedless'-derived F1 mapping populations confirmed the major effect of the SDI locus and delimited the sdi mutation to a 323-kb region on chromosome 18. RNA-sequencing comparing seed traces of seedless and seeds of seeded F1 individuals identified processes triggered during sdi-determined seed abortion, including the activation of salicylic acid-dependent autoimmunity. The RNA-sequencing data set was investigated for candidate genes, and while no evidence for causal cis-acting regulatory mutations was detected, deleterious nucleotide changes in coding sequences of the seedless haplotype were predicted in two genes within the sdi fine-mapping interval. Targeted resequencing of the two genes in a collection of 124 grapevine cultivars showed that only the point variation causing the arginine-197-to-leucine substitution in the seed morphogenesis regulator gene AGAMOUS-LIKE11 (VviAGL11) was fully linked with stenospermocarpy. The concurrent postzygotic variation identified for this missense polymorphism and seedlessness phenotype in seeded somatic variants of the original stenospermocarpic cultivar supports a causal effect. We postulate that seed abortion caused by this amino acid substitution in VviAGL11 is the major cause of seedlessness in cultivated grapevine. This information can be exploited to boost seedless grape breeding.

AB  - In flowering plants, repression of the seed maturation program is essential for the transition from the seed to the vegetative phase, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. The B3-domain protein VIVIPAROUS1/ABSCISIC ACID-INSENSITIVE3-LIKE 1 (VAL1) is involved in repressing the seed maturation program. Here we uncovered a molecular network triggered by the plant hormone brassinosteroid (BR) that inhibits the seed maturation program during the seed-to-seedling transition in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). val1-2 mutant seedlings treated with a BR biosynthesis inhibitor form embryonic structures, whereas BR signaling gain-of-function mutations rescue the embryonic structure trait. Furthermore, the BR-activated transcription factors BRI1-EMS-SUPPRESSOR 1 and BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT 1 bind directly to the promoter of AGAMOUS-LIKE15 (AGL15), which encodes a transcription factor involved in activating the seed maturation program, and suppress its expression. Genetic analysis indicated that BR signaling is epistatic to AGL15 and represses the seed maturation program by downregulating AGL15. Finally, we showed that the BR-mediated pathway functions synergistically with the VAL1/2-mediated pathway to ensure the full repression of the seed maturation program. Together, our work uncovered a mechanism underlying the suppression of the seed maturation program, shedding light on how BR promotes seedling growth.

AB  - MADS-domain transcription factors have been shown to act as key repressors or activators of the transition to flowering and as master regulators of reproductive organ identities. Despite their important roles in plant development, the origin of several MADS-box subfamilies has remained enigmatic so far. Here we demonstrate, through a combination of genome synteny and phylogenetic reconstructions, the origin of three major, apparently angiosperm-specific MADS-box gene clades: FLOWERING LOCUS C- (FLC-), SQUAMOSA- (SQUA-) and SEPALLATA- (SEP-)-like genes. We find that these lineages derive from a single ancestral tandem duplication in a common ancestor of extant seed plants. Contrary to common belief, we show that FLC-like genes are present in cereals where they can also act as floral repressors responsive to prolonged cold or vernalization. This opens a new perspective on the translation of findings from Arabidopsis to cereal crops, in which vernalization was originally described.

AB  - During development of flowering plants, some MIKC-type MADS-domain transcription factors (MTFs) exert their regulatory function as heterotetrameric complexes bound to two sites on the DNA of target genes. This way they constitute "floral quartets" or related "floral quartet-like complexes" (FQCs), involving a unique multimeric system of paralogous protein interactions. Tetramerization of MTFs is brought about mainly by interactions of keratin-like (K) domains. The K-domain associated with the more ancient DNA-binding MADS-domain during evolution in the stem group of extant streptophytes (charophyte green algae + land plants). However, whether this was sufficient for MTF tetramerization and FQC formation to occur, remains unknown. Here, we provide biophysical and bioinformatic data indicating that FQC formation likely originated in the stem group of land plants in a sublineage of MIKC-type genes termed MIKCC-type genes. In the stem group of this gene lineage, the duplication of the most downstream exon encoding the K-domain led to a C-terminal elongation of the second K-domain helix, thus, generating the tetramerization interface found in extant MIKCC-type proteins. In the stem group of the sister lineage of the MIKCC-type genes, termed MIKC*-type genes, the duplication of two other K-domain exons occurred, extending the K-domain at its N-terminal end. Our data indicate that this structural change prevents heterodimerization between MIKCC-type and MIKC*-type proteins. This way, two largely independent gene regulatory networks could be established, featuring MIKCC-type or MIKC*-type proteins, respectively, that control different aspects of plant development.

AB  - Several grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) cultivars show a tendency to develop parthenocarpic seedless grapes, affecting fruit yield and quality. This reproductive disorder originates in defective ovule fertilization due to a failure in pollen tube growth. Zinc (Zn) is a crucial trace element, playing a vital role in various physiological and metabolic processes. It is particularly essential for the healthy growth of flowers and fruits. Insufficient zinc has been suggested as a potential reason for issues in this development process. This microelement is taken up through a mechanism that involves transporters, including the ZRT-IRT-like protein (ZIP) gene family, associated with the influx of Zn into the cell. In grapevines, 20 genes for ZIP-type transporters have been described. In this study, we analyzed the expression pattern of VviZIP3 during flower development and employ transgenic methods to assess its transcriptional regulation. Furthermore, through computational examination of the promoter region, we identified two CArG boxes, recognized as responsive elements to MADS transcription factors. These factors play a key role in shaping various components of a flower, such as pollen. Our investigation of the VviZIP3 promoter confirms the functionality of these CArG boxes. Overall, our results suggest that the increased expression of VviZIP3 during flowering is likely under the influence of MADS transcription factors.

AB  - Arabidopsis thaliana SWP73A and SWP73B are homologs of mammalian BRAHMA-associated factors (BAF60s) that tether SWITCH/SUCROSE NONFERMENTING chromatin remodeling complexes to transcription factors of genes regulating various cell differentiation pathways. Here, we show that Arabidopsis thaliana SWP73s modulate several important developmental pathways. While undergoing normal vegetative development, swp73a mutants display reduced expression of FLOWERING LOCUS C and early flowering in short days. By contrast, swp73b mutants are characterized by retarded growth, severe defects in leaf and flower development, delayed flowering, and male sterility. MNase-Seq, transcript profiling, and ChIP-Seq studies demonstrate that SWP73B binds the promoters of ASYMMETRIC LEAVES1 and 2, KANADI1 and 3, and YABBY2, 3, and 5 genes, which regulate leaf development and show coordinately altered transcription in swp73b plants. Lack of SWP73B alters the expression patterns of APETALA1, APETALA3, and the MADS box gene AGL24, whereas other floral organ identity genes show reduced expression correlating with defects in flower development. Consistently, SWP73B binds to the promoter regions of APETALA1 and 3, SEPALLATA3, LEAFY, UNUSUAL FLORAL ORGANS, TERMINAL FLOWER1, AGAMOUS-LIKE24, and SUPPRESSOR OF CONSTANS OVEREXPRESSION1 genes, and the swp73b mutation alters nucleosome occupancy on most of these loci. In conclusion, SWP73B acts as important modulator of major developmental pathways, while SWP73A functions in flowering time control.

AB  - MADS-box genes encode transcription factors in all eukaryotic organisms thus far studied. Plant MADS-box proteins contain a DNA-binding (M), an intervening (I), a Keratin-like (K) and a C-terminal C-domain, thus plant MADS-box proteins are of the MIKC type. In higher plants most of the well-characterized genes are involved in floral development. They control the transition from vegetative to generative growth and determine inflorescence meristem identity. They specify floral organ identity as outlined in the ABC model of floral development. Moreover, in Antirrhinum majus the MADS-box gene products DEF/GLO and PLE control cell proliferation in the developing flower bud. In this species the DEF/GLO and the SQUA proteins form a ternary complex which determines the overall "Bauplan" of the flower. Phylogenetic reconstructions of MADS-box sequences obtained from ferns, gymnosperms and higher eudicots reveal that, although ferns possess already MIKC type genes, these are not orthologous to the well characterized MADS-box genes from gymnosperms or angiosperms. Putative orthologs of floral homeotic B- and C-function genes have been identified in different gymnosperms suggesting that these genes evolved some 300-400 million years ago. Both gymnosperms and angiosperms also contain a hitherto unknown sister clade of the B-genes, which we termed Bsister. A novel hypothesis will be described suggesting that B and Bsister might be involved in sex determination of male and female reproductive organs, respectively.

AB  - Dormancy-associated MADS-box (DAM) genes play an important role in endodormancy phase transition. We investigated histone modification in the DAM homolog (PpMADS13-1) from Japanese pear, via chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative PCR, to understand the mechanism behind the reduced expression of the PpMADS13-1 gene towards endodormancy release. Our results indicated that the reduction in the active histone mark by trimethylation of the histone H3 tail at lysine 4 contributed to the reduction of PpMADS13-1 expression towards endodormancy release. In contrast, the inactive histone mark by trimethylation of the histone H3 tail at lysine 27 in PpMADS13-1 locus was quite low, and these levels were more similar to a negative control [normal mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG)] than to a positive control (AGAMOUS) in endodormancy phase transition. The loss of histone variant H2A.Z also coincided with the down-regulation of PpMADS13-1. Subsequently, we investigated the PpMADS13-1 signalling cascade and found that PpCBF2, a pear C-repeated binding factor, regulated PpMADS13-1 expression via interaction of PpCBF2 with the 5'-upstream region of PpMADS13-1 by transient reporter assay. Furthermore, transient reporter assay confirmed no interaction between the PpMADS13-1 protein and the pear FLOWERING LOCUS T genes. Taken together, our results enhance understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying endodormancy phase transition in Japanese pear.

AB  - We isolated three dormancy-associated MADS-box (DAM) genes (MADS13-1, MADS13-2 and MADS13-3) and showed regulated expression concomitant with endodormancy establishment and release in the leaf buds of Japanese pear 'Kosui'. Comparative analysis between 'Kosui' and Taiwanese pear TP-85-119 ('Hengshanli'), a less dormant pear cultivar, showed reduction of MADS13-1 expression level in 'Hengshanli' earlier than in 'Kosui' towards endodormancy release, suggesting the possible relationship between chilling requirement and MADS13-1 expression. Application of hydrogen cyanamide accelerated endodormancy release with a reduction in MADS13 expression, whereas heat treatment in autumn inhibited endodormancy establishment without induction of MADS13 expression, indicating a close relationship between the MADS13 expression pattern and endodormancy phase transitions. Moreover, both the cis-acting regulatory elements and the methylation status in the 5' upstream region of the MADS13-1 gene were not largely different between 'Kosui' and 'Hengshanli'. Genomic structures of MADS13-1 from 'Kosui' and 'Hengshanli' revealed a 3218 bp insertion in the first intron of 'Hengshanli' that might be ascribed to the lower expression of MADS13-1tw; however, this insertion was also found in pear genotypes with a high chilling requirement. These results indicated that the low expression of MADS13-1 in 'Hengshanli' towards endodormancy release could not be explained by the identified cis-acting regulatory elements, the methylation status of the putative promoter or by intron insertion.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The circadian system drives pervasive biological rhythms in plants. Circadian clocks integrate endogenous timing information with environmental signals, in order to match rhythmic outputs to the local day/night cycle. Multiple signaling pathways affect the circadian system, in ways that are likely to be adaptively significant. Our previous studies of natural genetic variation in Arabidopsis thaliana accessions implicated FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) as a circadian-clock regulator. The MADS-box transcription factor FLC is best known as a regulator of flowering time. Its activity is regulated by many regulatory genes in the "autonomous" and vernalization-dependent flowering pathways. We tested whether these same pathways affect the circadian system. RESULTS: Genes in the autonomous flowering pathway, including FLC, were found to regulate circadian period in Arabidopsis. The mechanisms involved are similar, but not identical, to the control of flowering time. By mutant analyses, we demonstrate a graded effect of FLC expression upon circadian period. Related MADS-box genes had less effect on clock function. We also reveal an unexpected vernalization-dependent alteration of periodicity. CONCLUSION: This study has aided in the understanding of FLC's role in the clock, as it reveals that the network affecting circadian timing is partially overlapping with the floral-regulatory network. We also show a link between vernalization and circadian period. This finding may be of ecological relevance for developmental programming in other plant species.

AB  - EMBRYONIC FLOWER (EMF) genes are required to maintain vegetative development via repression of flower homeotic genes in Arabidopsis. Removal of EMF gene function caused plants to flower upon germination, producing abnormal and sterile flowers. The pleiotropic effect of emf1 mutation suggests its requirement for gene programs involved in diverse developmental processes. Transgenic plants harboring EMF1 promoter::glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene were generated to investigate the temporal and spatial expression pattern of EMF1. These plants displayed differential GUS activity in vegetative and flower tissues, consistent with the role of EMF1 in regulating multiple gene programs. EMF1::GUS expression pattern in emf mutants suggests organ-specific auto-regulation. Sense- and antisense (as) EMF1 cDNA were expressed under the control of stage- and tissue-specific promoters in transgenic plants. Characterization of these transgenic plants showed that EMF1 activity is required in meristematic as well as differentiating tissues to rescue emf mutant phenotype. Temporal removal or reduction of EMF1 activity in the embryo or shoot apex of wild-type seedlings was sufficient to cause early flowering and terminal flower formation in adult plants. Such reproductive cell memory is reflected in the flower MADS-box gene activity expressed prior to flowering in these early flowering plants. However, temporal removal of EMF1 activity in flower meristem did not affect flower development. Our results are consistent with EMF1's primary role in repressing flowering in order to allow for vegetative growth.

AB  - The control of floral organ identity by homeotic MADS box genes is well established in eudicots. However, grasses have highly specialized outer floral organs, and the identities of the genes that regulate the highly specialized outer floral organs of grasses remain unclear. In this study, we characterized a MIKC-type MADS box gene, CHIMERIC FLORAL ORGANS (CFO1), which plays a key role in the regulation of floral organ identity in rice (Oryza sativa). The cfo1 mutant displayed defective marginal regions of the palea, chimeric floral organs, and ectopic floral organs. Map-based cloning demonstrated that CFO1 encoded the OsMADS32 protein. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that CFO1/OsMADS32 belonged to a monocot-specific clade in the MIKC-type MADS box gene family. The expression domains of CFO1 were mainly restricted to the marginal region of the palea and inner floral organs. The floral organ identity gene DROOPING LEAF (DL) was expressed ectopically in all defective organs of cfo1 flowers. Double mutant analysis revealed that loss of DL function mitigated some of the defects of floral organs in cfo1 flowers. We propose that the CFO1 gene plays a pivotal role in maintaining floral organ identity through negative regulation of DL expression.

AB  - MADS box genes play important roles in specifying floral meristem and floral organ identity. We characterized the temporal and spatial expression patterns of two members of this gene family, AGL4 and AGL5 (for AGAMOUS [AG]-like). AGL4 RNA initially accumulates after the onset of expression of the floral meristem identity genes but before the onset of expression of the floral organ identity genes. AGL4 is, therefore, a putative target of the floral meristem identity genes and/or a potential regulator of the floral organ identity genes. AGL5 is initially expressed early in carpel development, shortly after the onset of AG expression. The loss of AGL5 expression in flowers of ag mutants, the activation of AGL5 by ectopic expression of AG, and the specific binding of AG to an element in the AGL5 promoter identify AGL5 as a putative direct target of AG. Our study provides possible links between the establishment of floral meristem and floral organ identity as well as subsequent steps in flower development.

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of HvMADS-box genes in lateral spikelet development in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). A set of 30 spike-contrasting barley lines were phenotypically and genotypically investigated under controlled conditions. We detected clear variations in the spike and spikelet development during the developmental stages among the tested lines. The lateral florets in the deficiens and semi-deficiens lines were more reduced than in two-rowed cultivars except cv. Kristina. Interestingly, cv. Kristina, int-h.43 and int-i.39 exhibited the same behavior as def.5, def.6, semi-def.1, semi-def.8 regarding development and showed reduced lateral florets size. In HOR1555, HOR7191 and HOR7041, the lateral florets continued their development, eventually setting seeds. In contrast, lateral florets in two-rowed barley stopped differentiating after the awn primordia stage giving rise to lateral floret sterility. At harvest, the lines tested showed large variation for all central and lateral spikelet-related traits. Phylogenetic analysis showed that more than half of the 108 MADS-box genes identified are highly conserved and are expressed in different barley tissues. Re-sequence analysis of a subset of these genes showed clear polymorphism in either SNPs or in/del. Variation in HvMADS56 correlated with altered lateral spikelet morphology. This suggests that HvMADS56 plays an important role in lateral spikelet development in barley.

AB  - The screening of enhancer detector lines in Arabidopsis thaliana has identified genes that are specifically expressed in the sporophytic tissue of the ovule. One such gene is the MADS-domain transcription factor AGAMOUS-LIKE6 (AGL6), which is expressed asymmetrically in the endothelial layer of the ovule, adjacent to the developing haploid female gametophyte. Transcription of AGL6 is regulated at multiple stages of development by enhancer and silencer elements located in both the upstream regulatory region and the large first intron. These include a bipartite enhancer, which requires elements in both the upstream regulatory region and the first intron, active in the endothelium. Transcription of the AGL13 locus, which encodes the other member of the AGL6 subfamily in Arabidopsis, is also regulated by elements located in the upstream regulatory region and in the first intron. There is, however, no overlapping expression of AGL6 and AGL13 except in the chalaza of the developing ovule, as was shown using a dual gene reporter system. Phylogenetic shadowing of the first intron of AGL6 and AGL13 homologs from other Brassicaceae identified four regions of conservation that probably contain the binding sites of transcriptional regulators, three of which are conserved outside Brassicaceae. Further phylogenetic analysis using the protein-encoding domains of AGL6 and AGL13 revealed that the MADS DNA-binding domain shows considerable divergence. Together, these results suggest that AGL6 and AGL13 show signs of subfunctionalization, with divergent expression patterns, regulatory sequences and possibly functions.

AB  - Six MADS-box cDNA clones were isolated by heterologous screening from a barley inflorescence cDNA library. Based on sequence comparison to known MADS-box genes, the barley MADS-box (BM) genes were grouped into three distinct phylogenetic subclasses of the MADS-box gene family. The three MADS-box genes BM3, BM5 and BM8 share similarities with genes of the SQUAMOSA (SQUA) subgroup, while BM7 and BM9 belong to the AGAMOUS-LIKE 2 (AGL2) subgroup. BM1 resembles MADS-box genes described as solitary sequences or orphan genes. Expression analysis of the barley MADS-box genes revealed expression patterns that are not characteristic of the barley MADS-box genes of the SQUA subgroup. while expression of BM7 and BM9 was largely as expected for the AGL2 subgroup. BM1 is mainly expressed in vegetative tissues and its primary transcript undergoes alternative splicing such that the corresponding mRNAs differ by two codons. The genes BM1, BM3 and BM8 were mapped by analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms onto barley chromosomes 4, 2 and 7, respectively.

AB  - Polycomb-group (PcG) proteins form a cellular memory by maintaining developmental regulators in a transcriptionally repressed state. We identified a novel flowering gene that is under PcG control in Arabidopsis--the MADS-box gene AGL19. AGL19 expression is maintained at very low levels by the PcG proteins MSI1, CLF, and EMF2, and AGL19 is partly responsible for the early flowering phenotype of clf mutants. AGL19 chromatin is strongly enriched in trimethylation of Lys 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3) but not in H3K9me2. Repressive H3K27me3 marks were reduced by decreased CLF or MSI1 levels and by prolonged cold, suggesting that the PcG proteins MSI1 and CLF repress AGL19 in the absence of cold. Ectopic expression of AGL19 strongly accelerates flowering, and agl19 mutants have a decreased response to vernalization, the promotion of flowering by prolonged cold. Epistasis analyses revealed that AGL19 works in the poorly characterized FLC-independent vernalization pathway and does not require SOC1 to function. In this pathway, prolonged cold relieves AGL19 from PcG repression by a mechanism that requires VIN3 but not VRN2. Elevated AGL19 levels activate LFY and AP1 and eventually cause flowering.

AB  - Angiosperm inflorescences develop in two fundamentally different ways. In monopodial plants, for example in Arabidopsis thaliana, the flowers are initiated as lateral appendages of a central indeterminate inflorescence meristem. In sympodial plants, flowers arise by terminal differentiation of the inflorescence meristem, while further inflorescence development proceeds from new sympodial meristems that are generated at the flank of the terminal flower. We have used the sympodial model species Petunia hybrida to investigate inflorescence development. Here, we describe a mutant, bonsai (bns), which is defective in flower formation, inflorescence branching, and control of meristem size. Detailed microscopic analysis revealed that bns meristems retain vegetative charateristics including spiral phyllotaxis. Consistent with a block in flower formation, bns mutants exhibit a deregulated expression of various MADS-box genes. Molecular analysis revealed that the bns mutant carries a transposon insertion in the previously described EVERGREEN (EVG) gene, which belongs to the WUSCHEL-LIKE HOMEOBOX (WOX) transcription factor gene family. EVG falls in the WOX9 subfamily, which has diverse developmental functions in angiosperms. The comparison of WOX9 orthologues in five model species for flowering shows that these genes play functionally divergent roles in monopodial and sympodial plants, indicating that the WOX9 regulatory node may have played an important role in the evolution of shoot architecture.

AB  - The timing of flowering is important for the reproductive success of plants. Here we describe the identification and characterization of a new MADS-box gene, FLOWERING LOCUS M (FLM), which is involved in the transition from vegetative to reproductive development. FLM is similar in amino-acid sequence to FLC, another MADS-box gene involved in flowering-time control. flm mutants are early flowering in both inductive and non-inductive photoperiods, and flowering time is sensitive to FLM dosage. FLM overexpression produces late-flowering plants. Thus FLM acts as an inhibitor of flowering. FLM is expressed in areas of cell division such as root and shoot apical regions and leaf primordia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Passiflora (passionflowers) makes an excellent model for studying plant evolutionary development. They are mostly perennial climbers that display axillary tendrils, which are believed to be modifications of the inflorescence. Passionflowers are also recognized by their unique flower features, such as the extra whorls of floral organs composed of corona filaments and membranes enclosing the nectary. Although some work on Passiflora organ ontogeny has been done, the developmental identity of both Passiflora tendrils and the corona is still controversial. Here, we combined ultrastructural analysis and expression patterns of the flower meristem and floral organ identity genes of the MADS-box AP1/FUL clade to reveal a possible role for these genes in the generation of evolutionary novelties in Passiflora. RESULTS: We followed the development of structures arising from the axillary meristem from juvenile to adult phase in P. edulis. We further assessed the expression pattern of P. edulis AP1/FUL homologues (PeAP1 and PeFUL), by RT-qPCR and in situ hybridization in several tissues, correlating it with the developmental stages of P. edulis. PeAP1 is expressed only in the reproductive stage, and it is highly expressed in tendrils and in flower meristems from the onset of their development. PeAP1 is also expressed in sepals, petals and in corona filaments, suggesting a novel role for PeAP1 in floral organ diversification. PeFUL presented a broad expression pattern in both vegetative and reproductive tissues, and it is also expressed in fruits. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide new molecular insights into the morphological diversity in the genus Passiflora. Here, we bring new evidence that tendrils are part of the Passiflora inflorescence. This points to the convergence of similar developmental processes involving the recruitment of genes related to flower identity in the origin of tendrils in different plant families. The data obtained also support the hypothesis that the corona filaments are likely sui generis floral organs. Additionally, we provide an indication that PeFUL acts as a coordinator of passionfruit development.

AB  - In the Arabidopsis thaliana seed pod, pod shatter and seed dispersal properties are in part determined by the development of a longitudinally orientated dehiscence zone (DZ) that derives from cells of the gynoecial valve margin (VM). Transcriptional regulation of the MADS protein encoding transcription factors genes SHATTERPROOF1 (SHP1) and SHATTERPROOF2 (SHP2) are critical for proper VM identity specification and later on for DZ development. Current models of SHP1 and SHP2 regulation indicate that the transcription factors FRUITFULL (FUL) and REPLUMLESS (RPL) repress these SHP genes in the developing valve and replum domains, respectively. Thus the expression of the SHP genes is restricted to the VM. FUL encodes a MADS-box containing transcription factor that is predicted to act through CArG-box containing cis-regulatory motifs. Here we delimit functional modules within the SHP2 cis-regulatory region and examine the functional importance of CArG box motifs within these regulatory regions. We have characterized a 2.2kb region upstream of the SHP2 translation start site that drives early and late medial domain expression in the gynoecium, as well as expression within the VM and DZ. We identified two separable, independent cis-regulatory modules, a 1kb promoter region and a 700bp enhancer region, that are capable of giving VM and DZ expression. Our results argue for multiple independent cis-regulatory modules that support SHP2 expression during VM development and may contribute to the robustness of SHP2 expression in this tissue. Additionally, three closely positioned CArG box motifs located in the SHP2 upstream regulatory region were mutated in the context of the 2.2kb reporter construct. Mutating simultaneously all three CArG boxes caused a moderate de-repression of the SHP2 reporter that was detected within the valve domain, suggesting that these CArG boxes are involved in SHP2 repression in the valve.

AB  - Transition to the reproductive phase, inflorescence formation and flower development are crucial elements that ensure maximum reproductive success in a plant's life cycle. To understand the regulatory mechanisms underlying correct flower development in barley (Hordeum vulgare), we characterized the multiovary 5 (mov5.o) mutant. This mutant develops abnormal flowers that exhibit mosaic floral organs typified by multiple carpels at the total or partial expense of stamens. Genetic mapping positioned mov5 on the long arm of chromosome 2H, incorporating a region that encodes HvLFY, the barley orthologue of LEAFY from Arabidopsis. Sequencing revealed that, in mov5.o plants, HvLFY contains a single amino acid substitution in a highly conserved proline residue. CRISPR-mediated knockout of HvLFY replicated the mov5.o phenotype, suggesting that HvLFY(mov5) represents a loss of function allele. In heterologous assays, the HvLFY(mov5) polymorphism influenced protein-protein interactions and affinity for a putative binding site in the promoter of HvMADS58, a C-class MADS-box gene. Moreover, molecular analysis indicated that HvLFY interacts with HvUFO and regulates the expression of floral homeotic genes including HvMADS2, HvMADS4 and HvMADS16. Other distinct changes in expression differ from those reported in the rice LFY mutants apo2/rfl, suggesting that LFY function in the grasses is modulated in a species-specific manner. This pathway provides a key entry point for the study of LFY function and multiple ovary formation in barley, as well as cereal species in general.

AB  - Correct floral development is the result of a sophisticated balance of molecular cues. Floral mutants provide insight into the main genetic determinants that integrate these cues, as well as providing opportunities to assess functional variation across species. In this study, we characterize the barley (Hordeum vulgare) multiovary mutants mov2.g and mov1, and propose causative gene sequences: a C2H2 zinc-finger gene HvSL1 and a B-class gene HvMADS16, respectively. In the absence of HvSL1, florets lack stamens but exhibit functional supernumerary carpels, resulting in multiple grains per floret. Deletion of HvMADS16 in mov1 causes homeotic conversion of lodicules and stamens into bract-like organs and carpels that contain non-functional ovules. Based on developmental, genetic, and molecular data, we propose a model by which stamen specification in barley is defined by HvSL1 acting upstream of HvMADS16. The present work identifies strong conservation of stamen formation pathways with other cereals, but also reveals intriguing species-specific differences. The findings lay the foundation for a better understanding of floral architecture in Triticeae, a key target for crop improvement.

AB  - The regulation of flowering time has crucial implications for plant fitness. MicroRNA156 (miR156) represses the floral transition in Arabidopsis thaliana, but the mechanisms regulating its transcription remain unclear. Here, we show that two AGAMOUS-like proteins, AGL15 and AGL18, act as positive regulators of the expression of MIR156. Small RNA northern blot analysis revealed a significant decrease in the levels of mature miR156 in agl15 agl18 double mutants, but not in the single mutants, suggesting that AGL15 and AGL18 co-regulate miR156 expression. Histochemical analysis further indicated that the double mutants showed a reduction in MIR156 promoter strength. The double mutants also showed reduced abundance of pri-miR156a and pri-miR156c, two of the primary transcripts from MIR156 genes. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that AGL15 directly associated with the CArG motifs in the MIR156a/c promoters. AGL18 did not show binding affinity to the CArG motifs, but pull-down and yeast two-hybrid assays showed that AGL18 forms a heterodimer with AGL15. GFP reporter assays and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) showed that AGL15 and AGL18 co-localize in the nucleus and confirmed their in vivo interaction. Overexpression of miR156 did not affect the levels of AGL15 and AGL18 transcripts. Taking these data together, we present a model for the transcriptional regulation of MIR156. In this model, AGL15 and AGL18 may form a complex along with other proteins, and bind to the CArG motifs of the promoters of MIR156 to activate the MIR156 expression.

AB  - Several genome-wide studies demonstrated that alternative splicing (AS) significantly increases the transcriptome complexity in plants. However, the impact of AS on the functional diversity of proteins is difficult to assess using genome-wide approaches. The availability of detailed sequence annotations for specific genes and gene families allows for a more detailed assessment of the potential effect of AS on their function. One example is the plant MADS-domain transcription factor family, members of which interact to form protein complexes that function in transcription regulation. Here, we perform an in silico analysis of the potential impact of AS on the protein-protein interaction capabilities of MIKC-type MADS-domain proteins. We first confirmed the expression of transcript isoforms resulting from predicted AS events. Expressed transcript isoforms were considered functional if they were likely to be translated and if their corresponding AS events either had an effect on predicted dimerisation motifs or occurred in regions known to be involved in multimeric complex formation, or otherwise, if their effect was conserved in different species. Nine out of twelve MIKC MADS-box genes predicted to produce multiple protein isoforms harbored putative functional AS events according to those criteria. AS events with conserved effects were only found at the borders of or within the K-box domain. We illustrate how AS can contribute to the evolution of interaction networks through an example of selective inclusion of a recently evolved interaction motif in the MADS AFFECTING FLOWERING1-3 (MAF1-3) subclade. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential effect of an AS event in SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP), resulting in the deletion of a short sequence stretch including a predicted interaction motif, by overexpression of the fully spliced and the alternatively spliced SVP transcripts. For most of the AS events we were able to formulate hypotheses about the potential impact on the interaction capabilities of the encoded MIKC proteins.

AB  - The ubiquity of nonparental hybrid phenotypes, such as hybrid vigor and hybrid inferiority, has interested biologists for over a century and is of considerable agricultural importance. Although examples of both phenomena have been subject to intense investigation, no general model for the molecular basis of nonadditive genetic variance has emerged, and prediction of hybrid phenotypes from parental information continues to be a challenge. Here we explore the genetics of hybrid phenotype in 435 Arabidopsis thaliana individuals derived from intercrosses of 30 parents in a half diallel mating scheme. We find that nonadditive genetic effects are a major component of genetic variation in this population and that the genetic basis of hybrid phenotype can be mapped using genome-wide association (GWA) techniques. Significant loci together can explain as much as 20% of phenotypic variation in the surveyed population and include examples that have both classical dominant and overdominant effects. One candidate region inherited dominantly in the half diallel contains the gene for the MADS-box transcription factor AGAMOUS-LIKE 50 (AGL50), which we show directly to alter flowering time in the predicted manner. Our study not only illustrates the promise of GWA approaches to dissect the genetic architecture underpinning hybrid performance but also demonstrates the contribution of classical dominance to genetic variance.

AB  - Rice (Oryza sativa L.) and Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) life cycles involve several major phase changes, throughout which MADS-box genes have a variety of functions. MADS-box genes are well recognized for their functions in floral induction and development, and some have multiple functions in apparently unrelated developmental stages. For example, in Arabidopsis, AGL15 and AGL6 play roles in both vegetative development and floral transition. Similarly, in rice, OsMADS1 is involved in flowering time and seed development, and OsMADS26 is expressed not only in the roots, but also in the leaves, shoots, panicles, and seeds. The roles of other MADS-box genes responsible for the regulation of specific traits in both rice and Arabidopsis are also discussed. Several are key components of gene regulatory networks involved in root development under diverse environmental factors such as drought, heat, and salt stress, and are also involved in the shift from vegetative to flowering growth in response to seasonal changes in environmental conditions. Thus, we argue that MADS-box genes are critical elements of gene regulation that underpin diverse gene expression profiles, each of which is linked to a unique developmental stage that occurs during root development and the shift from vegetative to reproductive growth.

AB  - Phylogenomic analyses show that gene and genome duplication events have led to the diversification of transcription factor gene families throughout the evolutionary history of land plants and that gene duplications have played an important role in shaping regulatory networks influencing key phenotypic characters including floral development and flowering time. A molecular evolutionary investigation of the mode and tempo of selection acting on the angiosperm MADS box AP1/SQUA, AP3/PI, AG/AGL11, and SEP gene subfamilies revealed site-specific patterns of shifting evolutionary constraint throughout angiosperm history. Specific positions in the four canonical MADS box gene regions, especially K domains and C-terminal regions of all four of these MADS box gene subfamilies exhibited clade-specific shifts in selective constraint following concerted duplication events. Moreover, the frequency of site-specific shifts in constraint was correlated with gene duplications and early angiosperm diversification. We hypothesize that coevolution among interacting MADS box proteins may be responsible for simultaneous increases in the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions (d(N)/d(S) = omega) early in angiosperm history and following concerted duplication events.

AB  - Members of the AP1/SQUA subfamily of plant MADS-box genes play broad roles in the regulation of reproductive meristems, the specification of sepal and petal identities, and the development of leaves and fruits. It has been shown that AP1/SQUA-like genes are angiosperm-specific, and have experienced several major duplication events. However, the evolutionary history of this subfamily is still uncertain. Here, we report the isolation of 14 new AP1/SQUA-like genes from seven early-diverging eudicots and the identification of 11 previously uncharacterized ESTs and genomic sequences from public databases. Sequence comparisons of these and other published sequences reveal a conserved C-terminal region, the FUL motif, in addition to the known euAP1/paleoAP1 motif, in AP1/SQUA-like proteins. Phylogenetic analyses further suggest that there are three major lineages (euAP1, euFUL, and AGL79) in core eudicots, likely resulting from two close duplication events that predated the divergence of core eudicots. Among the three lineages, euFUL is structurally very similar to FUL-like genes from early-diverging eudicots and basal angiosperms, whereas euAP1 might have originally been generated through a 1-bp deletion in the exon 8 of an ancestral euFUL- or FUL-like gene. Because euFUL- and FUL-like genes usually have broad expression patterns, we speculate that AP1/SQUA-like genes initially had broad functions. Based on these observations, the evolutionary fates of duplicate genes and the contributions of the frameshift mutation and alternative splicing to functional diversity are discussed.

AB  - The emergence of the carnivory syndrome and traps in plants is one of the most intriguing questions in evolutionary biology. In the present study, we addressed it by comparative transcriptomics analysis of leaves and leaf-derived pitcher traps from a predatory plant Nepenthes ventricosa x Nepenthes alata. Pitchers were collected at three stages of development and a total of 12 transcriptomes were sequenced and assembled de novo. In comparison with leaves, pitchers at all developmental stages were found to be highly enriched with upregulated genes involved in stress response, specification of shoot apical meristem, biosynthesis of sucrose, wax/cutin, anthocyanins, and alkaloids, genes encoding digestive enzymes (proteases and oligosaccharide hydrolases), and flowering-related MADS-box genes. At the same time, photosynthesis-related genes in pitchers were transcriptionally downregulated. As the MADS-box genes are thought to be associated with the origin of flower organs from leaves, we suggest that Nepenthes species could have employed a similar pathway involving highly conserved MADS-domain transcription factors to develop a novel structure, pitcher-like trap, for capture and digestion of animal prey during the evolutionary transition to carnivory. The data obtained should clarify the molecular mechanisms of trap initiation and development and may contribute to solving the problem of its emergence in plants.

AB  - Four full-length MADS-box cDNAs from chrysanthemum, designated Chrysanthemum Dendrathema grandiflorum MADS (CDM) 8, CDM41, CDM111, and CDM44, have been isolated and further functionally characterized. Protein sequence alignment and expression patterns of the corresponding genes suggest that CDM8 and CDM41 belong to the FRUITFULL (FUL) clade, CDM111 is a member of the APETALA1 (AP1) subfamily, and CDM44 is a member of the SEPALLATA3 (SEP3) subfamily of MADS-box transcription factors. Overexpression of CDM111 in Arabidopsis plants resulted in an aberrant phenotype that is reminiscent of the phenotype obtained by ectopic expression of the AP1 gene. In addition, CDM111 was able to partially complement the ap1-1 mutant from Arabidopsis, illustrating that CDM111 is the functional equivalent to AP1. Yeast two- and three-hybrid studies were performed to investigate the potential protein interactions and complexes in which these chrysanthemum MADS-box proteins are involved. Based on these studies, we conclude that CDM44 is most likely the SEP3 functional equivalent, because the CDM44 protein interacts with CDM proteins of the AP1/FUL and AG subfamilies, and as a higher order complex with the heterodimer between the presumed B-type CDM proteins.

AB  - A MADS box gene, FLF (for FLOWERING LOCUS F ), isolated from a late-flowering, T-DNA-tagged Arabidopsis mutant, is a semidominant gene encoding a repressor of flowering. The FLF gene appears to integrate the vernalization-dependent and autonomous flowering pathways because its expression is regulated by genes in both pathways. The level of FLF mRNA is downregulated by vernalization and by a decrease in genomic DNA methylation, which is consistent with our previous suggestion that vernalization acts to induce flowering through changes in gene activity that are mediated through a reduction in DNA methylation. The flf-1 mutant requires a greater than normal amount of an exogenous gibberellin (GA3) to decrease flowering time compared with the wild type or with vernalization-responsive late-flowering mutants, suggesting that the FLF gene product may block the promotion of flowering by GAs. FLF maps to a region on chromosome 5 near the FLOWERING LOCUS C gene, which is a semidominant repressor of flowering in late-flowering ecotypes of Arabidopsis.

AB  - Temperature is a major factor that regulates plant growth and phenotypic diversity. To ensure reproductive success at a range of temperatures, plants must maintain developmental stability of their sexual organs when exposed to temperature fluctuations. However, the mechanisms integrating plant floral organ development and temperature responses are largely unknown. Here, we generated barley and rice loss-of-function mutants in the SEPALLATA-like MADS-box gene MADS8. The mutants in both species form multiple carpels that lack ovules at high ambient temperatures. Tissue-specific markers revealed that HvMADS8 is required to maintain floral meristem determinacy and ovule initiation at high temperatures, and transcriptome analyses confirmed that temperature-dependent differentially expressed genes in Hvmads8 mutants predominantly associate with floral organ and meristem regulation. HvMADS8 temperature-responsive activity relies on increased binding to promoters of downstream targets, as revealed by a cleavage under targets and tagmentation (CUT&Tag) analysis. We also demonstrate that HvMADS8 directly binds to 2 orthologs of D-class floral homeotic genes to activate their expression. Overall, our findings revealed a new, conserved role for MADS8 in maintaining pistil number and ovule initiation in cereal crops, extending the known function of plant MADS-box proteins in floral organ regulation.

AB  - The ovules and egg cells are well developed to be fertilized at anthesis in many flowering plants. However, ovule development is triggered by pollination in most orchids. In this study, we characterized the function of a B(sister) gene, named PeMADS28, isolated from Phalaenopsis equestris, the genome-sequenced orchid. Spatial and temporal expression analysis showed PeMADS28 predominantly expressed in ovules between 32 and 48 days after pollination, which synchronizes with integument development. Subcellular localization and protein-protein interaction analyses revealed that PeMADS28 could form a homodimer as well as heterodimers with D-class and E-class MADS-box proteins. In addition, ectopic expression of PeMADS28 in Arabidopsis thaliana induced small curled rosette leaves, short silique length and few seeds, similar to that with overexpression of other species' B(sister) genes in Arabidopsis. Furthermore, complementation test revealed that PeMADS28 could rescue the phenotype of the ABS/TT16 mutant. Together, these results indicate the conserved function of B(sister) PeMADS28 associated with ovule integument development in orchid.

AB  - BACKGROUND: MADS-box transcription factors function as homo- or heterodimers and regulate many aspects of plant development; moreover, MADS-box genes have undergone extensive duplication and divergence. For example, the morphological diversity of floral organs is closely related to the functional divergence of the MADS-box gene family. B-class genes (such as Arabidopsis thaliana APETALA3 [AP3] and PISTILLATA [PI]) belong to a subgroup of MADS-box genes. Here, we collected 97 MADS-box B protein sequences from 21 seed plant species and examined their motifs to better understand the functional evolution of B proteins. RESULTS: We used the MEME tool to identify conserved sequence motifs in these B proteins; unique motif arrangements and sequences were identified in these B proteins. The keratin-like domains of Malus domestica and Populus trichocarpa B proteins differed from those in other angiosperms, suggesting that a novel regulatory network might have evolved in these species. The MADS domains of Nelumbo nucifera, Glycine max, and Amborella trichopoda B-proteins contained motif 9; in contrast, those of other plants contained motif 1. Protein modelling analyses revealed that MADS domains with motif 9 may lack amino acid sites required for DNA-binding. These results suggested that the three species might share an alternative mechanism controlling floral development. CONCLUSIONS: Amborella trichopoda has B proteins with either motif 1 or motif 9 MADS domains, suggesting that these two types of MADS domains evolved from the ancestral domain into two groups, those with motif 9 (N. nucifera and G. max), and those with motif 1. Moreover, our results suggest that the homodimer/heterodimer intermediate transition structure first appeared in A. trichopoda. Therefore, our systematic analysis of the motifs in B proteins sheds light on the evolution of these important transcription factors.

AB  - The morphological diversity of floral organs can largely be attributed to functional divergence in the MADS-box gene family. Nonetheless, research based on the ABCDE model has yet to conclusively determine whether the AGAMOUS-LIKE 6 (AGL6) subgroup has a direct influence on floral organ development. In the current study, the ABCDE model was used to quantify the contributions of ABCDE and AGL6 genes in the emergence of floral organs. We determined that the flower formation contribution values of the ABCDE and AGL6 genes were as follows: A gene, 0.192; B gene, 0.231; CD gene, 0.192; E gene, 0.385; and AGL6, 0.077. As AGL6 does not directly influence floral structure formation, the contribution value of AGL6 to flower formation was low. Furthermore, the gradient values of the floral organs were as follows: sepals, 0.572; petals, 1.606; stamens, 2.409; and carpels, 2.288. We also performed detailed analysis of the ABCDE and AGL6 genes using the Circlize package in R. Our results suggest that these genes likely emerged in one of two orders: 1) B genes-->CD genes-->AGL6-->E genes-->A genes; or 2) B genes-->CD genes-->AGL6/E genes-->A genes. We use the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to prove the contribution values and gradient values of floral organs. This is the first study to understand the contribution values of ABCDE and AGL6 genes using the AHP and the Circlize package in R.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The morphological diversity of flower organs is closely related to functional divergence within the MADS-box gene family. Bryophytes and seedless vascular plants have MADS-box genes but do not have ABCDE or AGAMOUS-LIKE6 (AGL6) genes. ABCDE and AGL6 genes belong to the subgroup of MADS-box genes. Previous works suggest that the B gene was the first ABCDE and AGL6 genes to emerge in plant but there are no mentions about the probable origin time of ACDE and AGL6 genes. Here, we collected ABCDE and AGL6 gene 381 protein sequences and 361 coding sequences from gymnosperms and angiosperms and reconstructed a complete Bayesian phylogeny of these genes. In this study, we want to clarify the probable origin time of ABCDE and AGL6 genes is a great help for understanding the role of the formation of the flower, which can decipher the forming order of MADS-box genes in the future. RESULTS: These genes appeared to have been under purifying selection and their evolutionary rates are not significantly different from each other. Using the Bayesian evolutionary analysis by sampling trees (BEAST) tool, we estimated that: the mutation rate of the ABCDE and AGL6 genes was 2.617 x 10(-3) substitutions/site/million years, and that B genes originated 339 million years ago (MYA), CD genes originated 322 MYA, and A genes shared the most recent common ancestor with E/AGL6 296 MYA, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The phylogeny of ABCDE and AGL6 genes subfamilies differed. The APETALA1 (AP1 or A gene) subfamily clustered into one group. The APETALA3/PISTILLATA (AP3/PI or B genes) subfamily clustered into two groups: the AP3 and PI clades. The AGAMOUS/SHATTERPROOF/SEEDSTICK (AG/SHP/STK or CD genes) subfamily clustered into a single group. The SEPALLATA (SEP or E gene) subfamily in angiosperms clustered into two groups: the SEP1/2/4 and SEP3 clades. The AGL6 subfamily clustered into a single group. Moreover, ABCDE and AGL6 genes appeared in the following order: AP3/PI --> AG/SHP/STK --> AGL6/SEP/AP1. In this study, we collected candidate sequences from gymnosperms and angiosperms.

AB  - Rice (Oryza sativa) OsMADS58 is a C-class MADS box protein, and characterization of a transposon insertion mutant osmads58 suggested that OsMADS58 plays a role in stamen development. However, as no null mutation has been obtained, its role has remained unclear. Here, we report that the CRISPR knockout mutant osmads58 exhibits complex altered phenotypes, including anomalous diploid germ cells, aberrant meiosis, and delayed tapetum degeneration. This CRISPR mutant line exhibited stronger changes in expression of OsMADS58 target genes compared with the osmads58 dSpm (transposon insertion) line, along with changes in multiple pathways related to early stamen development. Notably, transcriptional regulatory circuits in young panicles covering the stamen at stages 4-6 were substantially altered in the CRISPR line compared to the dSpm line. These findings strongly suggest that the pleiotropic effects of OsMADS58 on stamen development derive from a potential role in stabilizing gene regulatory circuits during early stamen development. Thus, this work opens new avenues for viewing and deciphering the regulatory mechanisms of early stamen development from a network perspective.

AB  - Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are known to play important roles in several plant processes such as flowering, organ development and stress response. However, studies exploring the diversity and complexity of lncRNAs and their mechanism of action in plants are far fewer that those in animals. Here, we show that an intronic lncRNA in rice (Oryza sativa L.), RICE FLOWERING ASSOCIATED (RIFLA), is required for the inhibition of OsMADS56 expression. RIFLA is produced from the first intron of the OsMADS56 gene. Overexpression of RIFLA in rice repressed OsMADS56 expression but activated the expression of flowering inducers Hd3a and RFT1. Additionally, RIFLA-overexpressing transgenic rice plants flowered earlier than the wild type. Under normal conditions, the transcript level of the rice enhancer of zeste gene OsiEZ1, a homolog of Arabidopsis histone H3K27-specific methyltransferase genes SWINGER (SWN) and CURLY LEAF (CLF), was as low as that of RIFLA, whereas the transcript level of OsMADS56 was relatively high. In the osiez1 mutant, OsMADS56 expression was upregulated, whereas RIFLA expression was downregulated. Additionally, RIFLA formed a complex with OsiEZ1. Together, these results suggest that the floral repressor activity of OsMADS56 is epigenetically regulated by RIFLA and OsiEZ1.

AB  - Seed development in angiosperms is dependent on the interplay among different transcriptional programs operating in the embryo, the endosperm, and the maternally-derived seed coat. In angiosperms, the embryo and the endosperm are products of double fertilization during which the two pollen sperm cells fuse with the egg cell and the central cell of the female gametophyte. In Arabidopsis, analyses of mutants in the cell-cycle regulator CYCLIN DEPENDENT KINASE A;1 (CKDA;1) have revealed the importance of a paternal genome for the effective development of the endosperm and ultimately the seed. Here we have exploited cdka;1 fertilization as a novel tool for the identification of seed regulators and factors involved in parent-of-origin-specific regulation during seed development. We have generated genome-wide transcription profiles of cdka;1 fertilized seeds and identified approximately 600 genes that are downregulated in the absence of a paternal genome. Among those, AGAMOUS-LIKE (AGL) genes encoding Type-I MADS-box transcription factors were significantly overrepresented. Here, AGL36 was chosen for an in-depth study and shown to be imprinted. We demonstrate that AGL36 parent-of-origin-dependent expression is controlled by the activity of METHYLTRANSFERASE1 (MET1) maintenance DNA methyltransferase and DEMETER (DME) DNA glycosylase. Interestingly, our data also show that the active maternal allele of AGL36 is regulated throughout endosperm development by components of the FIS Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), revealing a new type of dual epigenetic regulation in seeds.

AB  - Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) is a hexaploid species with A, B, and D ancestral genomes. Most bread wheat genes are present in the genome as triplicated homoeologous genes (homoeologs) derived from the ancestral species. Here, we report that both genetic and epigenetic alterations have occurred in the homoeologs of a wheat class E MADS box gene. Two class E genes are identified in wheat, wheat SEPALLATA (WSEP) and wheat LEAFY HULL STERILE1 (WLHS1), which are homologs of Os MADS45 and Os MADS1 in rice (Oryza sativa), respectively. The three wheat homoeologs of WSEP showed similar genomic structures and expression profiles. By contrast, the three homoeologs of WLHS1 showed genetic and epigenetic alterations. The A genome WLHS1 homoeolog (WLHS1-A) had a structural alteration that contained a large novel sequence in place of the K domain sequence. A yeast two-hybrid analysis and a transgenic experiment indicated that the WLHS1-A protein had no apparent function. The B and D genome homoeologs, WLHS1-B and WLHS1-D, respectively, had an intact MADS box gene structure, but WLHS1-B was predominantly silenced by cytosine methylation. Consequently, of the three WLHS1 homoeologs, only WLHS1-D functions in hexaploid wheat. This is a situation where three homoeologs are differentially regulated by genetic and epigenetic mechanisms.

AB  - Cereal grain develops from fertilised florets. Alterations in floret and grain development greatly influence grain yield and quality. Despite this, little is known about the underlying genetic control of these processes, especially in key temperate cereals such as barley and wheat. Using a combination of near-isogenic mutant comparisons, gene editing and genetic analyses, we reveal that HvAPETALA2 (HvAP2) controls floret organ identity, floret boundaries, and maternal tissue differentiation and elimination during grain development. These new roles of HvAP2 correlate with changes in grain size and HvAP2-dependent expression of specific HvMADS-box genes, including the B-sister gene, HvMADS29 Consistent with this, gene editing demonstrates that HvMADS29 shares roles with HvAP2 in maternal tissue differentiation. We also discovered that a gain-of-function HvAP2 allele masks changes in floret organ identity and grain size due to loss of barley LAXATUM.A/BLADE-ON-PETIOLE2 (HvBOP2) gene function. Taken together, we reveal novel pleiotropic roles and regulatory interactions for an AP2-like gene controlling floret and grain development in a temperate cereal.

TY  - JOUR
AB  - The MADS-box family of transcription factors has been defined on the basis of primary sequence similarity amongst numerous proteins from a diverse range of eukaryotic organisms including yeasts, plants, insects, amphibians and mammals. The MADS-box is a conserved motif found within the DNA-binding domains of these proteins and the name refers to four of the originally identified members: MCM1, AG, DEFA and SRF. Several proteins within this family have significant biological roles. For example, the human serum-response factor (SRF) is involved in co-ordinating transcription of the protooncogene c-fos, whilst MCM1 is central to the transcriptional control of cell-type specific genes and the pheromone response in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The RSRF/MEF2 proteins comprise a sub-family of this class of transcription factors which are key components in muscle-specific gene regulation. Moreover, in plants, MADS-box proteins such as AG, DEFA and GLO play fundamental roles during flower development. The MADS-box is a contiguous conserved sequence of 56 amino acids, of which 9 are identical in all family members described so far. Several members have been shown to form dimers and consequently two functional regions within the MADS-box have been defined. The N-terminal half is the major determinant of DNA-binding specificity whilst the C-terminal half is necessary for dimerisation. This organisation allows the potential formation of numerous proteins, with subtly different DNA-binding specificities, from a limited number of genes by heterodimerisation between different MADS-box proteins. The majority of MADS-box proteins bind similar sites based on the consensus sequence CC(A/T)6GG although each protein apparently possesses a distinct binding specificity. Moreover, several MADS-box proteins specifically recruit other transcription factors into multi-component regulatory complexes. Such interactions with other proteins appears to be a common theme within this family and play a pivotal role in the regulation of target genes.

AB  - Polycomb-group (PcG) proteins are evolutionarily conserved in higher organisms and play essential roles in many developmental processes by catalyzing the trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3), a key repressive histone mark. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), histone methyltransferase CURLY LEAF (CLF) is one of the major PcG catalytic components, playing critical roles in plant growth and development, especially the floral transition. We have recently profiled the genome-wide occupancy of CLF by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq). Interestingly, AGAMOUS-LIKE 17 (AGL17) that encodes a known flowering activator was found to be a CLF direct target. Based on this observation, we set out to examine to what extent this genetic module regulates the flowering. First, we validated the ChIP-seq results by ChIP-qPCR and show that CLF indeed targets AGL17, and the level of H3K27me3 is decreased when CLF is lost. Further, we show that the expression of AGL17 is significantly up-regulated in the clf-29 mutant compared to wild-type (WT). Finally, our clf agl17 double mutant analysis suggests that AGL17 is a significant downstream target of CLF in floral transition control.

AB  - Measurement of gene expression can provide important clues about gene function and molecular basis of developmental processes. Here, we have analysed the chickpea transcriptome in vegetative and flower tissues by exploiting the potential of high-throughput sequencing to measure gene expression. We mapped more than 295 million reads to quantify the transcript abundance during flower development. We detected the expression of more than 90% genes in at least one tissue analysed. We found quite a large number of genes were differentially expressed during flower development as compared to vegetative tissues. Further, we identified several genes expressed in a stage-specific manner. Various transcription factor families and metabolic pathways involved in flower development were elucidated. The members of MADS-box family were most represented among the transcription factor genes up-regulated during various stages of flower development. The abundant expression of several well-known genes implicated in flower development in chickpea flower development stages confirmed our results. In addition, we detected the expression specificities of lineage-specific genes during flower development. The expression data presented in this study is the most comprehensive dataset available for chickpea as of now and will serve as resource for unraveling the functions of many specific genes involved in flower development in chickpea and other legumes.

AB  - Members of the MADS-box transcription factor family play essential roles in almost every developmental process in plants. Many MADS-box genes have conserved functions across the flowering plants, but some have acquired novel functions in specific species during evolution. The analyses of MADS-domain protein interactions and target genes have provided new insights into their molecular functions. Here, we review recent findings on MADS-box gene functions in Arabidopsis and discuss the evolutionary history and functional diversification of this gene family in plants. We also discuss possible mechanisms of action of MADS-domain proteins based on their interactions with chromatin-associated factors and other transcriptional regulators.

AB  - Papaya is a fleshy fruit that undergoes fast ethylene-induced modifications. The fruit becomes edible, but the fast pulp softening is the main factor that limits the post-harvest period. Papaya fast pulp softening occurs due to cell wall disassembling coordinated by ethylene triggering that massively expresses pectinases. In this work, RNA-seq analysis of ethylene-treated and non-treated papayas enabled a wide transcriptome overview that indicated the role of ethylene during ripening at the gene expression level. Several families of transcription factors (AP2/ERF, NAC, and MADS-box) were differentially expressed. ACO, ACS, and SAM-Mtase genes were upregulated, indicating a high rate of ethylene biosynthesis after ethylene treatment. The correlation among gene expression and physiological data demonstrated ethylene treatment can indeed simulate ripening, and regulation of changes in fruit color, aroma, and flavor could be attributed to the coordinated expression of several related genes. Especially about pulp firmness, the identification of 157 expressed genes related to cell wall metabolism demonstrated that pulp softening is accomplished by a coordinated action of several different cell wall-related enzymes. The mechanism is different from other commercially important fruits, such as strawberry, tomato, kiwifruit, and apple. The observed behavior of this new transcriptomic data confirms ethylene triggering is the main event that elicits fast pulp softening in papayas.

AB  - The flowering mechanisms, especially chilling requirement-regulated flowering, in deciduous woody crops remain to be elucidated. Flower buds of northern highbush blueberry cultivar Aurora require approximately 1,000 chilling hours to bloom. Overexpression of a blueberry FLOWERING LOCUS T (VcFT) enabled precocious flowering of transgenic "Aurora" mainly in non-terminated apical buds during flower bud formation, meanwhile, most of the mature flower buds could not break until they received enough chilling hours. In this study, we highlighted two groups of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in flower buds caused by VcFT overexpression (VcFT-OX) and full chilling. We compared the two groups of DEGs with a focus on flowering pathway genes. We found: 1) In non-chilled flower buds, VcFT-OX drove a high VcFT expression and repressed expression of a major MADS-box gene, blueberry SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 (VcSOC1) resulting an increased VcFT/VcSOC1 expression ratio; 2) In fully chilled flower buds that are ready to break, the chilling upregulated VcSOC1 expression in non-transgenic "Aurora" and repressed VcFT expression in VcFT-OX "Aurora", and each resulted in a decreased ratio of VcFT to VcSOC1; additionally, expression of a blueberry SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (VcSVP) was upregulated in chilled flower buds of both transgenic and non-transgenic' "Aurora". Together with additional analysis of VcFT and VcSOC1 in the transcriptome data of other genotypes and tissues, we provide evidence to support that VcFT expression plays a significant role in promoting floral initiation and that VcSOC1 expression is a key floral activator. We thus propose a new hypothesis on blueberry flowering mechanism, of which the ratios of VcFT-to-VcSOC1 at transcript levels in the flowering pathways determine flower bud formation and bud breaking. Generally, an increased VcFT/VcSOC1 ratio or increased VcSOC1 in leaf promotes precocious flowering and flower bud formation, and a decreased VcFT/VcSOC1 ratio with increased VcSOC1 in fully chilled flower buds contributes to flower bud breaking.

AB  - MADS-box genes play a significant role for plant flowering. Keratin-like (K) domains are involved in protein-to-protein interactions in the formation of the MIKC-type MADS-box domain proteins. In this study, the potential of utilizing the K domain of a Vaccinium corymbosum SOC1-like gene (VcSOC1K) was investigated to modulate expression of other blueberry MADS-box genes for increasing blueberry productivity. Chilled transgenic blueberry plants overexpressing the VcSOC1K showed a significant increase in the number of canes, floral buds, and flower and fruit clusters compared to chilled non-transgenic plants. Additionally, nonchilled transgenic plants flowered whereas nonchilled non-transgenic plants did not. Transgenic plants showed an increase in tolerance to high soil pH. Comparative transcriptome analysis of transgenic and non-transgenic leaves showed differential expression of 17% of the MADS-box genes identified in blueberry. These differentially expressed (DE) MADS-box genes were associated with genes related to plant flowering, phytohormones, and response to various biotic and abiotic stimuli. The phenotypic changes and the DE MADS-box genes caused by the overexpression of VcSOC1K not only reveal that the MADS-box genes are involved in chilling/vernalization-mediated flowering in blueberry but also demonstrated that the overexpression of the K domain can effectively modulate plant reproductive processes.

AB  - MADS-box genes are considered as the foundation of all agronomic traits because they play essential roles in almost every aspect of plant reproductive development. Keratin-like (K) domain is a conserved protein domain of tens of MIKC-type MADS-box genes in plants. K-domain technology constitutively expresses a K-domain to mimic expression of the K-domains of other MADS-box genes simultaneously and thus to generate new opportunities for yield enhancement, because the increased K-domains can likely prevent MADS-domain proteins from binding to target DNA. In this study, we evaluated utilizing the K-domain technology to increase maize yield. The K-domain of a blueberry's SUPPRESSOR of CONSTITUTIVE EXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 (VcSOC1K) has similarities to five MADS-box genes in maize. Transgenic maize plants expressing the VcSOC1K showed 13-100% of more grain per plant than the nontransgenic plants in all five experiments conducted under different experimental conditions. Transcriptome comparisons revealed 982 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the leaves from 83-day old plants, supporting that the K-domain technology were powerful and multiple functional. The results demonstrated that constitutive expression of the VcSOC1K was very effective to enhance maize grain production. With the potential of mimicking the K-domains of multiple MADS-box genes, the K-domain technology opens a new approach to increase crop yield.

AB  - Overexpression of Zea mays SOC gene promotes flowering, reduces plant height, and leads to no reduction in grain production per plant, suggesting enhanced yield potential, at least, through increasing planting density. MIKC-type MADS-box gene SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 (SOC1) is an integrator conserved in the plant flowering pathway. In this study, the maize SOC1 (ZmSOC1) gene was cloned and overexpressed in transgenic maize Hi-II genotype. The T(0) plants were backcrossed with nontransgenic inbred B73 to produce first generation backcross (BC(1)) seeds. Phenotyping of both transgenic and null segregant (NT) BC(1) plants was conducted in three independent experiments. The BC(1) transgenic plants showed new attributes such as increased vegetative growth, accelerated flowering time, reduced overall plant height, and increased grain weight. Second generation backcross (BC(2)) plants were evaluated in the field using two planting densities. Compared to BC(2) NT plants, BC(2) transgenic plants, were 12-18% shorter, flowered 5 days earlier, and showed no reduction in grain production per plant and an increase in fat, starch, and simple sugars in the grain. Transcriptome comparison in young leaves of 56-day-old BC(1) plants revealed that the overexpressed ZmSOC1 resulted in 107 differentially expressed genes. The upregulated transcription factor DNA BINDING WITH ONE FINGER 5.4 (DOF5.4) was among the genes responsible for the reduced plant height. Modulating expression of SOC1 opens a new and effective approach to promote flowering and reduce plant height, which may have potential to enhance crop yield and improve grain quality.

AB  - Amphicarpaea edgeworthii, an annual twining herb, is a widely distributed species and an attractive model for studying complex flowering types and evolutionary mechanisms of species. Herein, we have generated a high-quality assembly of A. edgeworthii by using a combination of PacBio, 10x Genomics libraries, and Hi-C mapping technologies. The final 11 chromosome-level scaffolds covered 90.61% of the estimated genome (343.78Mb), which is a chromosome-scale assembled genome of an amphicarpic plant. Subsequently, we characterized the genetic diversity and population structure of A. edgeworthii species by resequencing individuals collected from their natural area of distribution. Using transcriptome profiling, we observed that specific phenotypes are regulated by a complex network of light, hormones, and MADS-box gene families. These data are beneficial for the discovery of genes that control major agronomic traits and spur genetic improvement of and functional genetic studies in legumes, as well as supply comparative genetic resources for other amphicarpic plants.

AB  - Most temperate species require prolonged exposure to winter chilling temperatures to flower in the spring. In the Brassicaceae, the MADS box transcription factor FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) is a major regulator of flowering in response to prolonged cold exposure, a process called vernalization. Winter annual Arabidopsis thaliana accessions initiate flowering in the spring due to the stable silencing of FLC by vernalization. The role of FLC has also been explored in perennials within the Brassicaceae family, such as Arabis alpina. The flowering pattern in A. alpina differs from the one in A. thaliana. A. alpina plants initiate flower buds during vernalization but only flower after subsequent exposure to growth-promoting conditions. Here we discuss the role of FLC in annual and perennial Brassicaceae species. We show that, besides its conserved role in flowering, FLC has acquired additional functions that contribute to vegetative and seed traits. PERPETUAL FLOWERING 1 (PEP1), the A. alpina FLC ortholog, contributes to the perennial growth habit. We discuss that PEP1 directly and indirectly, regulates traits such as the duration of the flowering episode, polycarpic growth habit and shoot architecture. We suggest that these additional roles of PEP1 are facilitated by (1) the ability of A. alpina plants to form flower buds during long-term cold exposure, (2) age-related differences between meristems, which enable that not all meristems initiate flowering during cold exposure, and (3) differences between meristems in stable silencing of PEP1 after long-term cold, which ensure that PEP1 expression levels will remain low after vernalization only in meristems that commit to flowering during cold exposure. These features result in spatiotemporal seasonal changes of PEP1 expression during the A. alpina life cycle that contribute to the perennial growth habit. FLC and PEP1 have also been shown to influence the timing of another developmental transition in the plant, seed germination, by influencing seed dormancy and longevity. This suggests that during evolution, FLC and its orthologs adopted both similar and divergent roles to regulate life history traits. Spatiotemporal changes of FLC transcript accumulation drive developmental decisions and contribute to life history evolution.

AB  - A panel of 387 durum wheat genotypes including Mediterranean landraces and modern cultivars was characterized with 46,161 diversity arrays technology (DArTseq) markers. Analysis of population structure uncovered the existence of five subpopulations (SP) related to the pattern of migration of durum wheat from the domestication area to the west of the Mediterranean basin (SPs 1, 2, and 3) and further improved germplasm (SPs 4 and 5). The total genetic diversity (H(T)) was 0.40 with a genetic differentiation (G(ST)) of 0.08 and a mean gene flow among SPs of 6.02. The lowest gene flow was detected between SP 1 (presumably the ancient genetic pool of the panel) and SPs 4 and 5. However, gene flow from SP 2 to modern cultivars was much higher. The highest gene flow was detected between SP 3 (western Mediterranean germplasm) and SP 5 (North American and European cultivars). A genome wide association study (GWAS) approach using the top ten eigenvectors as phenotypic data revealed the presence of 89 selective sweeps, represented as quantitative trait loci (QTL) hotspots, widely distributed across the durum wheat genome. A principal component analysis (PCoA) using 147 markers with -log(10)p > 5 identified three regions located on chromosomes 2A, 2B and 3A as the main drivers for differentiation of Mediterranean landraces. Gene flow between SPs offers clues regarding the putative use of Mediterranean old durum germplasm by the breeding programs represented in the structure analysis. EigenGWAS identified selective sweeps among landraces and modern cultivars. The analysis of the corresponding genomic regions in the 'Zavitan', 'Svevo' and 'Chinese Spring' genomes discovered the presence of important functional genes including Ppd, Vrn, Rht, and gene models involved in important biological processes including LRR-RLK, MADS-box, NAC, and F-box.

AB  - Three MADS-box genes were identified from a cDNA library derived from young flowers of Eucalyptus grandis W. Hill ex Maiden. The three egm genes are single-copy genes and are expressed almost exclusively in flowers. The egm1 and egm3 genes shared strongest homology with other plant MADS-box genes, which mediate between the floral meristem and the organ-identity genes. The egm3 gene was also expressed strongly in the receptacle or floral tube, which surrounds the carpels in the eucalypt flower and bears the sepals, petals, and numerous stamens. There appeared to be a group of genes in eucalypts with strong homology with the 3' region of the egm1 gene. The egm2 gene was expressed in eucalypt petals and stamens and was most homologous to MADS-box genes, which belong to the globosa group of genes, which regulate organogenesis of the second and third floral whorls. The possible role of these three genes in eucalypt floral development is discussed.

AB  - The central cell of the female gametophyte plays a role in pollen tube guidance and in regulating the initiation of endosperm development. Following fertilization, the central cell gives rise to the seed's endosperm, which nourishes the developing embryo within the seed. The molecular mechanisms controlling specification and differentiation of the central cell are poorly understood. We identified AGL61 in a screen for transcription factor genes expressed in the female gametophyte. AGL61 encodes a Type I MADS domain protein, which likely functions as a transcription factor. Consistent with this, an AGL61-green fluorescent protein fusion protein is localized to the nucleus. In the context of the ovule and seed, AGL61 is expressed exclusively in the central cell and early endosperm. agl61 female gametophytes are affected in the central cell specifically. The morphological defects include an overall reduction in size of the central cell and a reduced or absent central cell vacuole. When fertilized with wild-type pollen, agl61 central cells fail to give rise to endosperm. In addition, synergid- and antipodal-expressed genes are ectopically expressed in agl61 central cells. The expression pattern and mutant phenotype of AGL61 are similar to those of AGL80, suggesting that AGL61 may function as a heterodimer with AGL80 within the central cell; consistent with this, AGL61 and AGL80 interact in yeast two-hybrid assays. Together, these data suggest that AGL61 functions as a transcription factor and controls the expression of downstream genes during central cell development.

AB  - The VERNALIZATION1 (VRN1) gene encodes a MADS-box transcription factor and plays an important role in the cold-induced transition from the vegetative to reproductive stage. Allelic variability of VRN1 homoeologs has been associated with large differences in flowering time. The aim of this study was to investigate the genetic variability of VRN1 homoeologs (VRN-A1, VRN-B1 and VRN-D1). We performed an in-depth sequence analysis of VRN1 homoeologs in a panel of 105 winter and spring varieties of hexaploid wheat. We describe the novel allele Vrn-B1f with an 836 bp insertion within intron 1 and show its specific expression pattern associated with reduced heading time. We further provide the complete sequence of the Vrn-A1b allele, revealing a 177 bp insertion in intron 1, which is transcribed into an alternative splice variant. Copy number variation (CNV) analysis of VRN1 homoeologs showed that VRN-B1 and VRN-D1 are present in only one copy. The copy number of recessive vrn-A1 ranged from one to four, while that of dominant Vrn-A1 was one or two. Different numbers of Vrn-A1a copies in the spring cultivars Branisovicka IX/49 and Bastion did not significantly affect heading time. We also report on the deletion of secondary structures (G-quadruplex) in promoter sequences of cultivars with more vrn-A1 copies.

AB  - The transition from vegetative to reproductive growth is the most dramatic phase change in plants. To better understand the molecular regulation of floral transition and flower development in red-fleshed apple (Malus sieversii f. niedzwetzkyana), we isolated and characterized a floral MADS-box gene, MdAGL24-like, which shares sequence similarity with AGAMOUS-LIKE 24 (AGL24) from other species. Spatial expression analysis showed that MdAGL24-like dynamically expressed in flowers, followed by roots and fruits. Subcellular localization analysis indicated that, like other transcript factors, MdAGL24-like was localized in the nucleus. Protein interaction analysis showed that MdAGL24-like could interact with MdSOC1 and MdAP1 in vivo and in vitro. MdAGL24-like and MdSOC1 could increase each other's expression by binding the CArG motifs in their promoters. Unlike MdSOC1, MdAGL24-like might indirectly promote the expression of MdLFY by upregulating the expression of MdSOC1. Ectopic expression of MdAGL24-like in wild-type Arabidopsis induced early flowering like the phenotypes induced by other AGL24 genes. Similar to AGL24 in Arabidopsis, MdAGL24-like could rescue the late-flowering phenotype of the agl24 mutant to some extent. These results help clarify the molecular mechanism underlying flowering and provide a means of shortening the juvenile period in red-fleshed apples and other fruit trees.

AB  - Anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin play important roles in plant secondary metabolism. Although previous studies identified many transcription factors involved in anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin synthesis, the effects of MADS-box transcription factors are unclear in apple. Brassinosteroids (BRs) are steroid hormones that affect plant flavonoid biosynthesis, but the underlying regulatory mechanism is not yet well established. In this study, we identified a MADS-box transcription factor, MdJa2, which contained a highly conserved MADS-box domain and belonged to the STMADS11 subfamily. Additionally, MdJa2 was responsive to BR signal, and the overexpression of MdJa2 inhibited the synthesis of anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin. The silencing of MdJa2 in "Orin" calli promoted anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin accumulations. Moreover, MdJa2 interacted with MdBZR1. MdJa2 was revealed to independently regulate anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin synthesis pathways. The MdJa2-MdBZR1 complex enhanced the binding of MdJa2 to the promoters of downstream target genes. Our research provides new insights into how MADS-box transcription factors in the BR signaling pathway control the accumulations of anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin in red-fleshed apple.

AB  - BACKGROUND: MADS-box transcription factors (TFs) are the key regulators of multiple developmental processes in plants; among them, a chrysanthemum MADS-box TF CmANR1 has been isolated and described as functioning in root development in response to high nitrate concentration signals. However, how CmANR1 affects root and shoot development remains unclear. RESULTS: We report that CmANR1 plays a positive role in root system development in chrysanthemum throughout the developmental stages of in vitro tissue cultures. Metabolomics combined with transcriptomics assays show that CmANR1 promotes robust root system development by facilitating nitrate assimilation, and influencing the metabolic pathways of amino acid, glycolysis, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) cycle. Also, we found that the expression levels of TFs associated with the nitrate signaling pathways, such as AGL8, AGL21, and LBD29, are significantly up-regulated in CmANR1-transgenic plants relative to the wild-type (WT) control; by contrast, the expression levels of RHD3-LIKE, LBD37, and GATA23 were significantly down-regulated. These results suggest that these nitrate signaling associated TFs are involved in CmANR1-modulated control of root development. In addition, CmANR1 also acts as a positive regulator to control shoot growth and development. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide potential mechanisms of MADS-box TF CmANR1 modulation of root and shoot development, which occurs by regulating a series of nitrate signaling associated TFs, and influencing the metabolic pathways of amino acid and glycolysis, as well as TCA cycle and nitrate assimilation.

AB  - Root system architecture is an important agronomic trait by which plants both acquire water and nutrients from the soil and adapt to survive in a complex environment. The adaptation of plant root systems to environmental constraints largely depends on the growth and development of lateral roots (LRs). MADS-box transcription factors (TFs) are important known regulators of plant growth, development, and response to environmental stimuli. However, the potential mechanisms by which they regulate LRs development remain poorly understood. Here, we identified a MADS-box chrysanthemum gene CmANR1, homologous to the Arabidopsis gene AtANR1, which plays a key role in the regulation of LR development. qRT-PCR assays indicated that CmANR1 was primarily expressed in chrysanthemum roots and was rapidly induced by exposure to high nitrate concentrations. Ectopic expression of CmANR1 in Arabidopsis significantly increased the number and length of emerged LRs compared to the wild-type (col) control, but had no obvious affect on primary root (PR) development. We also found that CmANR1 positively influenced auxin accumulation in LRs at least partly by improving auxin biosynthesis and transport, thereby promoting LR development. Furthermore, we found that ANR1 formed homo- and heterodimers through interactions with itself and AGL21 at its C-terminal domain. Overall, our findings provide considerable new information about the mechanisms by which the chrysanthemum MADS-box TF CmANR1 mediates LR development by directly altering auxin accumulation.

AB  - Flowering is an important developmental process from vegetative to reproductive growth in plant; thus, it is necessary to analyze the genes involved in the regulation of flowering time. The MADS-box transcription factor family exists widely in plants and plays an important role in the regulation of flowering time. However, the molecular mechanism of GmFULc involved in the regulation of plant flowering is not very clear. In this study, GmFULc protein had a typical MADS domain and it was a member of MADS-box transcription factor family. The expression analysis revealed that GmFULc was induced by short days (SD) and regulated by the circadian clock. Compared to wild type (WT), overexpression of GmFULc in transgenic Arabidopsis caused significantly earlier flowering time, while ful mutants flowered later, and overexpression of GmFULc rescued the late-flowering phenotype of ful mutants. ChIP-seq of GmFULc binding sites identified potential direct targets, including TOPLESS (TPL), and it inhibited the transcriptional activity of TPL. In addition, the transcription levels of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS1 (SOC1) and LEAFY (LFY) in the downstream of TPL were increased in GmFULc-&nbsp;overexpressionArabidopsis, suggesting that the early flowering phenotype was associated with up-regulation of these genes. Our results suggested that GmFULc inhibited the transcriptional activity of TPL and induced expression of FT, SOC1 and LFY to promote flowering.

AB  - In our previous efforts to understand the regulatory mechanisms of cucumber unisexual flower development, we observed a stamen-specific down-regulation of the ethylene receptor CsETR1 in stage 6 female flowers of cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.). This down-regulation is correlated with the primordial anther-specific DNA damage that characterizes inappropriate stamen development in cucumber female flowers. To understand how CsETR1 is down regulated in the stamen, we characterized a cucumber MADS box gene homologous to Arabidopsis AP3, CsAP3. We demonstrated that CsAP3 is functionally equivalent to the Arabidopsis B-class MADS gene AP3. However, three novel characteristics of CsAP3 were found. These include firstly, binding and activating CsETR1 promoter in vitro and in vivo; secondly, containing a GV repeat in its C-terminus, which is conserved in cucurbits and required for the transcription activation; and thirdly, decreased expression as the node number increases, which is similar to that found for CsETR1. These findings revealed not only the conserved function of CsAP3 as a B-class floral identity gene, but also its unique functions in regulation of female flower development in cucumber.

AB  - The transition from vegetative to reproductive growth in perennial woody plants does not occur until after several years of repeated seasonal changes and alternative growth. To better understand the molecular basis of flowering regulation in citrus, a MADS-box gene was isolated from trifoliate orange (precocious trifoliate orange, Poncirus trifoliata L. Raf.). Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis showed that the MADS-box gene is more closely related to the homologs of the AGAMOUS-LIKE 24 (AGL24) lineage than to any of the other MADS-box lineages known from Arabidopsis; it is named PtAGL24. Expression analysis indicated that PtAGL24 was widely expressed in the most organs of trifoliate orange, with the higher expression in mature flowers discovered by real-time PCR. Ectopic expression of PtAGL24 in wild-type Arabidopsis promoted early flowering and caused morphological changes in class I transgenic Arabidopsis. Yeast two-hybrid assay revealed that PtAGL24 interacted with Arabidopsis AtAGL24 and other partners of AtAGL24, suggesting that the abnormal morphology of PtAGL24 overexpression in transgenic Arabidopsis was likely due to the inappropriate interactions between exogenous and endogenous proteins. Also, PtAGL24 interacted with SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS1 (PtSOC1) and APETALA1 (PtAP1) of citrus. These results suggest that PtAGL24 may play an important role in the process of floral transition but may have diverse functions in citrus development.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: MADS-box transcriptional regulators play important roles during plant development. Based on phylogenetic reconstruction, the AP1/SEP/AGL6 superclade of floral MADS-box genes underwent one or two duplication events in the common ancestor of the core eudicots. However, the functional evolution of the AP1/SEP/AGL6 superclade in basal eudicots remains uncharacterized. Epimedium sagittatum is a basal eudicot species valued for its medicinal properties and showing unique floral morphology. In this study, structural and functional variation of FUL-like (AP1 subfamily), SEP-like and AGL6-like genes in this species was investigated to further our understanding of flower evolution in angiosperms. Detailed investigations into the microsynteny and evolutionary history of the floral A and E class MADS-box genes in eudicots were undertaken and used to trace their genomic rearrangements. METHODS: One AP1-like gene, two SEP-like genes and one AGL6-like gene were cloned from E. sagittatum. Their expression patterns were examined using quantitative RT-PCR in different vegetative and reproductive organs at two developmental stages. Yeast two-hybrid assays were carried out among AP1/SEP/AGL6 superclade, AP3/PI and AGAMOUS subfamily members for elucidation of dimerization patterns. In addition, possible formation of a ternary complex involving B class proteins with the A class protein EsFUL-like, the E class SEP-like protein EsAGL2-1 or the AGL6-class protein EsAGL6 were detected using yeast three-hybrid assays. Transgenic Arabidopsis or tobacco plants expressing EsFUL-like, EsAGL2-1 and EsAGL6-like under the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter were generated and analysed. Genomic studies of AP1 syntenic regions in arabidopsis, columbine, strawberry, papaya, peach, grapevine and tomato were conducted for microsyntenic analyses. KEY RESULTS: Sequence and phylogenetic analyses showed that EsFUL-like is a member of the AP1 (A class) subfamily, EsAGL2-1 and EsAGL2-2 belong to the SEP-like (E class) subfamily, and EsAGL6-like belongs to the AGL6 (AGL6 class) subfamily. Quantitative RT-PCR analyses revealed that the transcripts of the four genes are absent, or minimal, in vegetative tissues and are most highly expressed in floral organs. Yeast two-hybrid results revealed that of the eight MADS-box proteins tested, only EsAGL6-like, EsAGL2-1 and EsAGL2 were able to form strong homo- and heterodimers, with EsAGL6-like and EsAGL2-1 showing similar interaction patterns. Yeast three-hybrid analysis revealed that EsFUL1-like, EsAGL6-like and EsAGL2-1 (representing the three major lineages of the Epimedium AGL/SEP/ALG6 superclade) could act as bridging proteins in ternary complexes with both EsAP3-2 (B class) and EsPI (B class), which do not heterodimerize themselves. Syntenic analyses of sequenced basal eudicots, rosids and asterids showed that most AP1-like and SEP-like genes have been tightly associated as neighbours since the origin of basal eudicots. Ectopic expression of EsFUL-like in arabidopsis caused early flowering through endogenous high-level expression of AP1 and formation of secondary flowers between the first and second whorls. Tobacco plants with ectopic expression of EsAGL2-1 showed shortened pistils and styles, as well as axillary and extra petals in the initial flower. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a description of EsFUL-like, EsAGL2-1, EsAGL2-2 and EsAGL6-like function divergence and conservation in comparison with a selection of model core eudicots. The study also highlights how organization in genomic segments containing A and E class genes in sequenced model species has resulted in similar topologies of AP1 and SEP-like gene trees.

AB  - Vernalization is the requirement for exposure to low temperatures to trigger flowering. The best knowledge about the mechanisms of vernalization response has been accumulated for Arabidopsis and cereals. In Arabidopsis thaliana, vernalization involves an epigenetic silencing of the MADS-box gene FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), which is a flowering repressor. FLC silencing releases the expression of the main flowering inductor FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), resulting in a floral transition. Remarkably, no FLC homologues have been identified in the vernalization-responsive legumes, and the mechanisms of cold-mediated transition to flowering in these species remain elusive. Nevertheless, legume FT genes have been shown to retain the function of the main vernalization signal integrators. Unlike Arabidopsis, legumes have three subclades of FT genes, which demonstrate distinct patterns of regulation with respect to environmental cues and tissue specificity. This implies complex mechanisms of vernalization signal propagation in the flowering network, that remain largely elusive. Here, for the first time, we summarize the available information on the genetic basis of cold-induced flowering in legumes with a special focus on the role of FT genes.

AB  - SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP)-like genes belonging to the StMADS11 subfamily of MADS-box transcription factors have important functions in the control of flowering time and floral organ specification and are thought to have been essential during angiosperm evolution. In this study, we identified the legume StMADS11 subfamily and examined the expression patterns of these SVP-like genes in the crop legume pea, under different photoperiod conditions and in key pea flowering mutants. We found three subclades of SVP-like genes represented in all legumes examined, including pea, common bean, soybean, Lotus japonicus and Medicago truncatula. These three subclades were also represented in other eudicot species. Legume SVPa genes fell within a eudicot SVP subclade that includes Arabidopsis SVP and tomato JOINTLESS (J), SVPb genes were found to be members of the StMADS11 subclade, and SVPc genes fell within the StMADS16/AGL24 subclade with the DORMANCY ASSOCIATED MADS-BOX (DAM) genes. In pea, we found SVP-like genes to be expressed in both leaf and apex tissues under inductive LD and non-inductive SD conditions. SVPc exhibited a clear developmental pattern of induction and downregulation under both conditions in both tissue types and showed misregulation in a mutant for the pea VEGETATIVE2 (VEG2) gene (an FD homolog), suggesting a possible role for SVPc in flowering, downstream of VEG2. The characterisation of legume SVP-like genes and expression analysis of the three pea SVP-like genes performed in this study provide a basis for further investigation of the function of these important transcription factors.

AB  - Plant development is continually fine-tuned based on environmental factors. How environmental perturbations are integrated into the developmental programs and how poststress adaptation is regulated remains an important topic to dissect. Vegetative to reproductive phase change is a very important developmental transition that is complexly regulated based on endogenous and exogenous cues. Proper timing of flowering is vital for reproductive success. It has been shown previously that AGAMOUS LIKE 16 (AGL16), a MADS-box transcription factor negatively regulates flowering time transition through FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), a central downstream floral integrator. AGL16 itself is negatively regulated by the microRNA miR824. Here we present a comprehensive molecular analysis of miR824/AGL16 module changes in response to mild and recurring heat stress. We show that miR824 accumulates gradually in response to heat due to the combination of transient transcriptional induction and posttranscriptional stability. miR824 induction requires heat shock cis-elements and activity of the HSFA1 family and HSFA2 transcription factors. Parallel to miR824 induction, its target AGL16 is decreased, implying direct causality. AGL16 posttranscriptional repression during heat stress, however, is more complex, comprising of a miRNA-independent, and a miR824-dependent pathway. We also show that AGL16 expression is leaf vein-specific and overlaps with miR824 (and FT) expression. AGL16 downregulation in response to heat leads to a mild derepression of FT. Finally, we present evidence showing that heat stress regulation of miR824/AGL16 is conserved within Brassicaceae. In conclusion, due to the enhanced post-transcriptional stability of miR824, stable repression of AGL16 is achieved following heat stress. This may serve to fine-tune FT levels and alter flowering time transition. Stress-induced miR824, therefore, can act as a "posttranscriptional memory factor" to extend the acute impact of environmental fluctuations in the poststress period.

AB  - Japanese cultivated gentians are perennial plants that flower in early summer to late autumn in Japan, depending on the cultivar. Several flowering-related genes, including GtFT1 and GtTFL1, are known to be involved in regulating flowering time, but many such genes remain unidentified. In this study, we obtained transcriptome profiling data using the Gentiana triflora cultivar 'Maciry', which typically flowers in late July. We conducted deep RNA sequencing analysis using gentian plants grown under natural field conditions for three months before flowering. To investigate diurnal changes, the plants were sampled at 4 h intervals over 24 h. Using these transcriptome data, we determined the expression profiles of leaves based on homology searches against the Flowering-Interactive Database of Arabidopsis. In particular, we focused on transcription factor genes, belonging to the BBX and MADS-box families, and analyzed their developmental and diurnal variation. The expression levels of representative BBX genes were also analyzed under long- and short-day conditions using in-vitro-grown seedlings, and the expression patterns of some BBX genes differed. Clustering analysis revealed that the transcription factor genes were coexpressed with GtFT1. Overall, these expression profiles will facilitate further analysis of the molecular mechanisms underlying the control of flowering time in gentians.

AB  - The MADS-box genes of land plants are extensively diverged to form a superfamily and are important in various aspects of development including the specification of floral organs as homeotic selector genes. The closest relatives of land plants are the freshwater green algae charophyceans. To study the origin and evolution of land plant MADS-box genes, we characterized these genes in three charophycean green algae: the stonewort Chara globularis, the coleochaete Coleochaete scutata, and the desmid Closterium peracerosum-strigosum-littorale complex. Phylogenetic analyses suggested that MADS-box genes diverged extensively in the land plant lineage after the separation of charophyceans from land plants. The stonewort C. globularis mRNA was specifically detected in the oogonium and antheridium together with the egg and spermatozoid during their differentiation. The expression of the C. peracerosum-strigosum-littorale-complex gene increased when vegetative cells began to differentiate into gametangial cells and decreased after fertilization. These expression patterns suggest that the precursors of land plant MADS-box genes originally functioned in haploid reproductive cell differentiation and that the haploid MADS-box genes were recruited into a diploid generation during the evolution of land plants.

AB  - The consensus model for floral organ formation in higher plants, the so-called ABCDE model, proposes that floral whorl-specific combinations of class A, B, C, D, and E genes specify floral organ identity. Class A, B, C, D and E genes encode MADS-box transcription factors; the single exception being the class A gene APETALA2. Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) is a hexaploid species with a genome constitution AABBDD; the hexaploid originated from a cross between tetraploid T. turgidum (AABB) and diploid Aegilops tauschii (DD). Tetraploid wheat is thought to have originated from a cross between the diploid species T. urartu (AA) and Ae. speltoides (BB). Consequently, the hexaploid wheat genome contains triplicated homoeologous copies (homoeologs) of each gene derived from the different ancestral diploid species. In this study, we examined the expression patterns of homoeologs of class B, C and D MADS-box genes during floral development. For the class B gene wheat PISTILLATA2 (WPI2), the homoeologs from the A and D genomes were expressed, while expression of the B genome homoeolog was suppressed. For the class C gene wheat AGAMOUS1 (WAG1), the homoeologs on the A and B genomes were expressed, while expression of the D genome homoeolog was suppressed. For the class D gene wheat SEEDSTICK (WSTK), the B genome homoeolog was preferentially expressed. These differential patterns of homoeolog expression were consistently observed among different hexaploid wheat varieties and synthetic hexaploid wheat lines developed by artificial crosses between tetraploid wheat and Ae. tauschii. These results suggest that homoeolog-specific regulation of the floral MADS-box genes occurs in allopolyploid wheat.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fruit set is a key process for crop production in tomato which occurs after successful pollination and fertilization naturally. However, parthenocarpic fruit development can be uncoupled from fertilization triggered by exogenous auxin or gibberellins (GAs). Global transcriptome knowledge during fruit initiation would help to characterize the molecular mechanisms by which these two hormones regulate pollination-dependent and -independent fruit set. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this work, digital gene expression tag profiling (DGE) technology was applied to compare the transcriptomes from pollinated and 2, 4-D/GA3-treated ovaries. Activation of carbohydrate metabolism, cell division and expansion as well as the down-regulation of MADS-box is a comprehensive regulatory pathway during pollination-dependent and parthenocarpic fruit set. The signaling cascades of auxin and GA are significantly modulated. The feedback regulations of Aux/IAAs and DELLA genes which functioned to fine-tune auxin and GA response respectively play fundamental roles in triggering fruit initiation. In addition, auxin regulates GA synthesis via up-regulation of GA20ox1 and down-regulation of KNOX. Accordingly, the effect of auxin on fruit set is mediated by GA via ARF2 and IAA9 down-regulation, suggesting that both pollination-dependent and parthenocarpic fruit set depend on the crosstalk between auxin and GA. SIGNIFICANCE: This study characterizes the transcriptomic features of ovary development and more importantly unravels the integral roles of auxin and GA on pollination-dependent and parthenocarpic fruit set.

AB  - A MADS-domain transcription factor LoSVP, which could delay flowering through vernalization pathway, was isolated from lily. Abstract MADS-domain transcription factors play important roles in plant growth and development, especially in the transition from vegetative phase to reproductive phase. However, their functions in bulbous flowering plants are largely unknown. In this work, a SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) encoding genes LoSVP from oriental lily was isolated. Bioinformatic analyses demonstrated that LoSVP encodes a type II MADS-box protein containing a conserved MADS-box, as well as a conserved K-box domain. Semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) revealed ubiquitous expression of LoSVP in various tissues, including petals, stamens, pistils, leaves and scales. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses demonstrated that LoSVP was predominantly expressed in the early stage of developing flowers. Constitutive expression of LoSVP in Arabidopsis led to significantly delayed flowering of transgenic plants. These results suggest that LoSVP is involved in plant flowering and could be used as a potential candidate gene for the genetic regulation of flowering time in higher plants.

AB  - MADS-box genes are key components of the networks that control the transition to flowering and flower development, but their role in vegetative development is poorly understood. This article shows that the sister gene of the AGAMOUS (AG) clade, AGL12, has an important role in root development as well as in flowering transition. We isolated three mutant alleles for AGL12, which is renamed here as XAANTAL1 (XAL1): Two alleles, xal1-1 and xal1-2, are in Columbia ecotype and xal1-3 is in Landsberg erecta ecotype. All alleles have a short-root phenotype with a smaller meristem, lower rate of cell production, and abnormal root apical meristem organization. Interestingly, we also encountered a significantly longer cell cycle in the strongest xal1 alleles with respect to wild-type plants. Expression analyses confirmed the presence of XAL1 transcripts in roots, particularly in the phloem. Moreover, XAL1beta-glucuronidase expression was specifically up-regulated by auxins in this tissue. In addition, mRNA in situ hybridization showed that XAL1 transcripts were also found in leaves and floral meristems of wild-type plants. This expression correlates with the late-flowering phenotypes of the xal1 mutants grown under long days. Transcript expression analysis suggests that XAL1 is an upstream regulator of SOC, FLOWERING LOCUS T, and LFY. We propose that XAL1 may have similar roles in both root and aerial meristems that could explain the xal1 late-flowering phenotype.

AB  - Evolutionary developmental genetics (evodevotics) is a novel scientific endeavor which assumes that changes in developmental control genes are a major aspect of evolutionary changes in morphology. Understanding the phylogeny of developmental control genes may thus help us to understand the evolution of plant and animal form. The principles of evodevotics are exemplified by outlining the role of MADS-box genes in the evolution of plant reproductive structures. In extant eudicotyledonous flowering plants, MADS-box genes act as homeotic selector genes determining floral organ identity and as floral meristem identity genes. By reviewing current knowledge about MADS-box genes in ferns, gymnosperms and different types of angiosperms, we demonstrate that the phylogeny of MADS-box genes was strongly correlated with the origin and evolution of plant reproductive structures such as ovules and flowers. It seems likely, therefore, that changes in MADS-box gene structure, expression and function have been a major cause for innovations in reproductive development during land plant evolution, such as seed, flower and fruit formation.

AB  - The MADS-box encodes a novel type of DNA-binding domain found so far in a diverse group of transcription factors from yeast, animals, and seed plants. Here, our first aim was to evaluate the primary structure of the MADS-box. Compilation of the 107 currently available MADS-domain sequences resulted in a signature which can strictly discriminate between genes possessing or lacking a MADS-domain and allowed a classification of MADS-domain proteins into several distinct subfamilies. A comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of known eukaryotic MADS-box genes, which is the first comprising animal as well as fungal and plant homologs, showed that the vast majority of subfamily members appear on distinct subtrees of phylogenetic trees, suggesting that subfamilies represent monophyletic gene clades and providing the proposed classification scheme with a sound evolutionary basis. A reconstruction of the history of the MADS-box gene subfamilies based on the taxonomic distribution of contemporary subfamily members revealed that each subfamily comprises highly conserved putative orthologs and recent paralogs. Some subfamilies must be very old (1,000 MY or more), while others are more recent. In general, subfamily members tend to share highly similar sequences, expression patterns, and related functions. The defined species distribution, specific function, and strong evolutionary conservation of the members of most subfamilies suggest that the establishment of different subfamilies was followed by rapid fixation and was thus highly advantageous during eukaryotic evolution. These gene subfamilies may have been essential prerequisites for the establishment of several complex eukaryotic body structures, such as muscles in animals and certain reproductive structures in higher plants, and of some signal transduction pathways. Phylogenetic trees indicate that after establishment of different subfamilies, additional gene duplications led to a further increase in the number of MADS-box genes. However, several molecular mechanisms of MADS-box gene diversification were used to a quite different extent during animal and plant evolution. Known plant MADS-domain sequences diverged much faster than those of animals, and gene duplication and sequence diversification were extensively used for the creation of new genes during plant evolution, resulting in a relatively large number of interacting genes. In contrast, the available data on animal genes suggest that increase in gene number was only moderate in the lineage leading to mammals, but in the case of MEF2-like gene products, heterodimerization between different splice variants may have increased the combinatorial possibilities of interactions considerably. These observations demonstrate that in metazoan and plant evolution, increased combinatorial possibilities of MADS-box gene product interactions correlated with the evolution of increasingly complex body plans.

AB  - In a world of global warming, the question emerges whether all plants have suitable mechanisms to keep pace with the rapidly changing environment. Most previous studies have focused on either the ability of plants to rapidly acclimatize via physiological and developmental plasticity, or long-term adaptation over thousands of years. However, we wonder whether plants can also adapt to changes in the environment within only a few generations. We hypothesize that rapidly evolving clusters of tandemly duplicated developmental control genes represent a source for fast adaptation. Specifically, we propose that a tandem cluster of FLC-like MADS-box genes involved in the transition to flowering in Arabidopsis functions as a facilitator for rapid adaptation to changes in ambient temperature.

AB  - Lisianthus [Eustoma grandiflorum (Raf.) Shinn] is a popular cut flower crop throughout the world, and the demand for this plant for cut flowers and potted plants has been increasing worldwide. Recent advances in genetic engineering have enabled the transformation and regeneration of plants to become a powerful tool for improvement of lisianthus. We have established a highly efficient plant regeneration system and Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation of E. grandiflorum. The greatest shoot regeneration frequency and number of shoot buds per explant are observed on media supplemented with 6-Benzylaminopurine (BAP) and alpha-Naphthalene acetic acid (NAA). We report an efficient plant regeneration system using leaf explants via organogenesis with high efficiency of transgenic plants (15%) in culture of 11 weeks' duration. Further ectopic expression of two MADS box genes, LMADS1-M from lily (Lilium longiflorum) and OMADS1 from orchid (Oncidium Gower Ramsey), was performed in E. grandiflorum. Conversion of second whorl petals into sepal-like structures and alteration of third whorl stamen formation were observed in the transgenic E. grandiflorum plants ectopically expressing 35S::LMADS1-M. 35S::OMADS1 transgenic E. grandiflorum plants flowered significantly earlier than non-transgenic plants. This is the first report on the ectopic expression of two MADS box genes in E. grandiflorum using a simple and highly efficient gene transfer protocol. Our results reveal the potential for floral modification in E. grandiflorum through genetic transformation.

AB  - Although many genes that regulate floral development have been identified in Arabidopsis thaliana, relatively few are known in the grasses. In normal maize (Zea mays), each spikelet produces an upper and lower floral meristem, which initiate floral organs in a defined phyllotaxy before being consumed in the production of an ovule. The bearded-ear (bde) mutation affects floral development differently in the upper and lower meristem. The upper floral meristem initiates extra floral organs that are often mosaic or fused, while the lower floral meristem initiates additional floral meristems. We cloned bde by positional cloning and found that it encodes zea agamous3 (zag3), a MADS box transcription factor in the conserved AGAMOUS-LIKE6 clade. Mutants in the maize homolog of AGAMOUS, zag1, have a subset of bde floral defects. bde zag1 double mutants have a severe ear phenotype, not observed in either single mutant, in which floral meristems are converted to branch-like meristems, indicating that bde and zag1 redundantly promote floral meristem identity. In addition, BDE and ZAG1 physically interact. We propose a model in which BDE functions in at least three distinct complexes to regulate floral development in the maize ear.

AB  - Canna indica is a common ornamental plant with asymmetric flowers having colourful petaloid staminodes. The only fertile stamen comprises a one-theca anther and a petaloid appendage and represents the lowest stamen number in the order Zingiberales. The molecular mechanism for the asymmetric androecial petaloidy remains poorly understood. Here, we studied the identity specification in Canna stamen. We observed four types of abnormal flower in terms of androecium identity transformation and analysed the corresponding floral symmetry changes. We further tested the expression patterns of B- and C-class MADS-box genes using in situ hybridization in normal Canna stamen. Homeotic conversions in the androecium were accompanied by floral symmetry changes, and the asymmetric stamen is key in contributing to the floral asymmetry. Both B- and C-class genes exhibited higher expression levels in the anther primordium than in other androecial parts. This asymmetric expression pattern precisely corresponded to the asymmetric identities of the Canna androecium. We identified C. indica as a model species for studying androecial organ identity and floral symmetry synthetically in Zingiberales. We hypothesized that homeotic genes specify floral organ identity in a putative dose-dependent manner. The results add to the current understanding of organ identity-related floral symmetry.

AB  - Spot blotch disease caused by Bipolaris sorokiniana is a major constraint for wheat production in tropics and subtropics. The introgression of spot blotch resistance alleles to the disease susceptible lines is critical to securing the wheat production in these regions. Although genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for spot blotch were attempted earlier, the present study focused on identifying new quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for spot blotch under natural disease pressure in diverse field conditions. A total of 139 advanced spring wheat lines were evaluated in three environments (three years and two locations) in India and Bangladesh. The GWAS using 14,063 polymorphic genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) markers identified eight QTLs associated with spot blotch disease resistance belonging to eight chromosomes across the wheat genome. Here, we report the identified marker-trait associations (MTAs), along with the allele effects associated with the disease. The functional annotation of the significant markers identified NBS-LRR, MADS-box transcription factor, and 34 other plant-related protein families across multiple chromosomal regions. The results indicate four promising new QTLs on chromosomes 1A (497.2 Mb), 1D (89.84 Mb), 2B (421.92 Mb), and 6D (6.84 Mb) associated with several disease resistance protein families. These results provide insights into new genomic regions associated with spot blotch disease, and with additional validation, could be utilized in disease resistance breeding efforts in wheat development.

AB  - There have been a considerable number of studies that have successfully sped up the flowering cycle in woody perennial horticultural species. One particularly successful study in apple (Malus domestica) accelerated flowering using a silver birch (Betula pendula) APETALA1/FRUITFULL MADS-box gene BpMADS4, which yielded a good balance of vegetative growth to support subsequent flower and fruit development. In this study, BpMADS4 was constitutively expressed in European pear (Pyrus communis) to establish whether this could be used as a tool in a rapid pear breeding program. Transformed pear lines flowered within 6-18 months after grafting onto a quince (Cydonia oblonga) rootstock. Unlike the spindly habit of early flowering apples, the early flowering pear lines displayed a normal tree-like habit. Like apple, the flower appearance was normal, and the flowers were fertile, producing fruit and seed upon pollination. Seed from these transformed lines were germinated and 50% of the progeny flowered within 3 months of sowing, demonstrating a use for these in a fast breeding program.

AB  - Recent climate change has resulted in warmer temperatures. Warmer temperatures from autumn to spring has negatively affected dormancy progression, cold (de)acclimation, and cold tolerance in various temperate fruit trees. In Japan, a physiological disorder known as flowering disorder, which is an erratic flowering and bud break disorder, has recently emerged as a serious problem in the production of the pome fruit tree, Japanese (Asian) pear (Pyrus pyrifolia Nakai). Due to global warming, the annual temperature in Japan has risen markedly since the 1990s. Surveys of flowering disorder in field-grown and greenhouse-grown Japanese pear trees over several years have indicated that flowering disorder occurs in warmer years and cultivation conditions, and the risk of flowering disorder occurrence is higher at lower latitudes than at higher latitudes. Susceptibility to flowering disorder is linked to changes in the transcript levels of putative dormancy/flowering regulators such as DORMANCY-ASSOCIATED MADS-box (DAM) and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT). On the basis of published studies, we conclude that autumn-winter warm temperatures cause flowering disorder through affecting cold acclimation, dormancy progression, and floral bud maturation. Additionally, warm conditions also decrease carbohydrate accumulation in shoots, leading to reduced tree vigor. We propose that all these physiological and metabolic changes due to the lack of chilling during the dormancy phase interact to cause flowering disorder in the spring. We also propose that the process of chilling exposure rather than the total amount of chilling may be important for the precise control of dormancy progression and robust blooming, which in turn suggests the necessity of re-evaluation of the characteristics of cultivar-dependent chilling requirement trait. A full understanding of the molecular and metabolic regulatory mechanisms of both dormancy completion (floral bud maturation) and dormancy break (release from the repression of bud break) will help to clarify the physiological basis of dormancy-related physiological disorder and also provide useful strategies to mitigate or overcome it under global warming.

AB  - MADS-box transcription factors are major regulators of development in flowering plants. The factors act in a combinatorial manner, either as homo- or heterodimers, and they control floral organ formation and identity and many other developmental processes through a complex network of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. Despite the fact that many studies have been carried out to elucidate MADS-box protein dimerization by yeast systems, very little information is available on the behaviour of these molecules in planta. Here, evidence for specific interactions between the petunia MADS-box proteins FBP2, FBP11, and FBP24 is provided in vivo. The dimers identified in yeast for the ovule-specific FBP24 protein have been confirmed in living plant cells by means of fluorescence resonance energy transfer-fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy and, in addition, some of the most likely, less stable homo- and heterodimers were identified. This in vivo approach revealed that particular dimers could only be detected in specific sub-nuclear domains. In addition, evidence for the in planta assembly of these ovule-specific MADS-box transcription factors into higher-order complexes is provided.

AB  - In angiosperms, endosperm development comprises a series of developmental transitions controlled by genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that are initiated after double fertilization. Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is a key component of these mechanisms that mediate histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3); the action of PRC2 is well described in Arabidopsis thaliana but remains uncertain in cereals. In this study, we demonstrate that mutation of the rice (Oryza sativa) gene EMBRYONIC FLOWER2a (OsEMF2a), encoding a zinc-finger containing component of PRC2, causes an autonomous endosperm phenotype involving proliferation of the central cell nuclei with separate cytoplasmic domains, even in the absence of fertilization. Detailed cytological and transcriptomic analyses revealed that the autonomous endosperm can produce storage compounds, starch granules, and protein bodies specific to the endosperm. These events have not been reported in Arabidopsis. After fertilization, we observed an abnormally delayed developmental transition in the endosperm. Transcriptome and H3K27me3 ChIP-seq analyses using endosperm from the emf2a mutant identified downstream targets of PRC2. These included >100 transcription factor genes such as type-I MADS-box genes, which are likely required for endosperm development. Our results demonstrate that OsEMF2a-containing PRC2 controls endosperm developmental programs before and after fertilization.

AB  - Arabidopsis plants flower in response to long days (LDs). Exposure of leaves to inductive day lengths activates expression of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) protein which moves to the shoot apical meristem (SAM) to induce developmental reprogramming. SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 (SOC1) and FRUITFULL (FUL) are induced by FT at the apex. We previously screened the SAM for mRNAs of genes required to promote the floral transition in response to photoperiod, and conducted detailed expression and functional analyses on several putative candidates. Here, we show that expression of AGAMOUS-LIKE 24 (AGL24) is detected at the SAM under SD conditions and increases upon exposure to LDs. Mutations in AGL24 further delay flowering of a soc1 ful double mutant, suggesting that flowering is controlled by AGL24 partly independently of SOC1 and FUL.

AB  - By comparing expression levels of MADS box transcription factor genes between near-isogenic winter and spring lines of bread wheat, Triticum aestivum, we have identified WAP1 as the probable candidate for the Vrn-1 gene, the major locus controlling the vernalization flowering response in wheat. WAP1 is strongly expressed in spring wheats and moderately expressed in semispring wheats, but is not expressed in winter wheat plants that have not been exposed to vernalization treatment. Vernalization promotes flowering in winter wheats and strongly induces expression of WAP1. WAP1 is located on chromosome 5 in wheat and, by synteny with other cereal genomes, is likely to be collocated with Vrn-1. These results in hexaploid bread wheat cultivars extend the conclusion made by Yan et al. [Yan, L., Loukoianov, A., Tranquilli, G., Helguera, M., Fahima, T. & Dubcovsky, J. (2003) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 100, 6263-6268] in the diploid wheat progenitor Triticum monococcum that WAP1 (TmAP1) corresponds to the Vrn-1 gene. The barley homologue of WAP1, BM5, shows a similar pattern of expression to WAP1 and TmAP1. BM5 is not expressed in winter barleys that have not been vernalized, but as with WAP1, expression of BM5 is strongly induced by vernalization treatment. In spring barleys, the level of BM5 expression is determined by interactions between the Vrn-H1 locus and a second locus for spring habit, Vrn-H2. There is now evidence that AP1-like genes determine the time of flowering in a range of cereal and grass species.

AB  - Analysis of the functions of Short Vegetative Phase (SVP)-like MADS-box genes in barley (Hordeum vulgare) indicated a role in determining meristem identity. Three SVP-like genes are expressed in vegetative tissues of barley: Barley MADS1 (BM1), BM10, and Vegetative to Reproductive Transition gene 2. These genes are induced by cold but are repressed during floral development. Ectopic expression of BM1 inhibited spike development and caused floral reversion in barley, with florets at the base of the spike replaced by tillers. Head emergence was delayed in plants that ectopically express BM1, primarily by delayed development after the floral transition, but expression levels of the barley VRN1 gene (HvVRN1) were not affected. Ectopic expression of BM10 inhibited spike development and caused partial floral reversion, where florets at the base of the spike were replaced by inflorescence-like structures, but did not affect heading date. Floral reversion occurred more frequently when BM1 and BM10 ectopic expression lines were grown in short-day conditions. BM1 and BM10 also inhibited floral development and caused floral reversion when expressed in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). We conclude that SVP-like genes function to suppress floral meristem identity in winter cereals.

AB  - In the pear 'Kosui' (Pyrus pyrifolia Nakai), the dormancy-associated MADS-box (PpDAM1 = PpMADS13-1) gene has been reported to play an essential role in bud endodormancy. Here, we found that PpDAM1 up-regulated expression of 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (PpNCED3), which is a rate-limiting gene for ABA biosynthesis. Transient assays with a dual luciferase reporter system (LUC assay) and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed that PpDAM1 activated PpNCED3 expression by binding to the CArG motif in the PpNCED3 promoter. PpNCED3 expression was increased toward endodormancy release in lateral flower buds of 'Kosui', which is consistent with the induced levels of ABA, its catabolism (ABA 8'-hydroxylase) and signaling genes (type 2C protein phosphatase genes and SNF1-related protein kinase 2 genes). In addition, we found that an ABA response element (ABRE)-binding transcription factor, PpAREB1, exhibiting high expression concomitant with endodormancy release, bound to three ABRE motifs in the promoter region of PpDAM1 and negatively regulated its activity. Taken together, our results suggested a feedback regulation between PpDAM1 and the ABA metabolism and signaling pathway during endodormancy of pear. This first evidence of an interaction between a DAM and ABA biosynthesis in vitro will provide further insights into bud endodormancy regulatory mechanisms of deciduous trees including pear.

AB  - SOC1, a MADS-box type II transcription factor, integrates environmental and endogenous cues to promote flowering in angiosperms. Recent reports implicating SOC1 in roles beyond floral transition prompted functional characterization of SOC1 in polyploid rapeseed mustard genomes. Gene characterization in Brassicas necessitates analysis of composite homeolog function. While insertional mutagenesis is untenable in Brassicas owing to gene redundancy, gain-of-function approach entails serial characterization of individual homeologs. Herein, we demonstrate modulated floral promotive effects in natural variants of Brassica SOC1 and provide lateral branching as a probable outcome of polyploidy-induced gene diversification. Ectopic expression of two B genome specific SOC1 variants in Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in differential floral acceleration and manifestation of multiple vegetative rosettes. Characterization of composite homeolog function in B. juncea via introgression of Brassica SOC1 specific artificial miRNA, designed to target homeologs, also exhibited modifications in floral transition and lateral branching. Comprehensive analysis of field performance of B. juncea transgenics displayed altered fitness across 11 agronomic traits. Crucially, reduced SOC1 levels directly impacted two developmental traits, namely, flowering time and number of lateral branches which in turn influenced several dependent agronomic traits. While delayed flowering and crop maturity resulted in altered fatty acid composition with higher SFA and lower PUFA in transgenics relative to controls, reduction in overall count of lateral branches caused a concomitant decrease in silique count which ultimately impacted total seed yield in transgenics. Statistical analysis revealed number of secondary branches as the most critical trait influencing seed yield. Based on our findings, we propose enhancing levels Brassica SOC1, a key target, for achieving earliness in flowering, improved seed yield and oil quality, and studying trait trade-offs.

AB  - Two MADS box genes, Lily MADS Box Gene 2 (LMADS2) and Eustoma grandiflorum MADS Box Gene 1 (EgMADS1), with an extensive similarity to the petunia (Petunia hybrida) FLORAL BINDING PROTEIN 7/11 and Arabidopsis AGL11, were characterized from the lily (Lilium longiflorum) and lisianthus (Eustoma grandiflorum). The expression of LMADS2 and EgMADS1 mRNA was restricted to the carpel and was absent in the other flower organs or vegetative leaves. LMADS2 mRNA was detected mainly in ovules and weakly in style tissues of the carpel, whereas EgMADS1 mRNA was only expressed in the ovules. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants ectopically expressing LMADS2 or EgMADS1 showed similar novel phenotypes resembling 35S::AGAMOUS plants by significantly reducing plant size, flowering early, and losing inflorescence indeterminacy. Ectopic expression of these two genes also generated similar ap2-like flowers by inducing homeotic conversion of the sepals into carpel-like structures in which stigmatic papillae and ovules were observed. In addition, the petals were converted into stamen-like structures in the second whorl of 35S::LMADS2 and 35S::EgMADS1 transgenic Arabidopsis. Our data indicated that LMADS2 and EgMADS1 are putative D functional MADS box genes in lily and lisianthus with a function similar to C functional genes once ectopically expressed in Arabidopsis.

AB  - To understand the role of the MIKC-type dormancy-associated MADS-box (DAM) genes in the regulation of endodormancy in japanese pear (Pyrus pyrifolia), we isolated two DAM genes from ‘Kosui’ and characterized their expression throughout the seasonal endodormancy phases in ‘Kosui’, as well as in TP-85–119 taiwanese pear (P. pyrifolia), which is a less dormant type. Several copies of the corresponding DAM genes are present in the P. pyrifolia genome. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends enabled the isolation of two full-length cDNAs, designated as PpMADS13–1 and PpMADS13–2, with complete open reading frames encoding 227 and 234 amino acids, respectively. Multialignment of the two ‘Kosui’ and the database DAM genes (based on the deduced amino acid sequences) showed that PpMADS13–1 and PpMADS13–2 were highly identical to the Rosaceae DAM genes and encoded the conserved domains characteristic of other MIKC-type MADS-box genes. The phylogenetic relationships showed that PpMADS13–1 and PpMADS13–2 were more closely related to the Prunus DAM, though they formed a unique subclade. The specific expression analysis of PpMADS13–1 and PpMADS13–2 by real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that both DAM genes are gradually down-regulated concomitant with endodormancy breaking. PpMADS13–1 and PpMADS13–2 showed similar fluctuations in expression patterns, although PpMADS13–2 was more highly expressed relative to PpMADS13–1. The expression of PpMADS13–1 and PpMADS13–2 in the less dormant taiwanese pear, TP-85–119, was quite low (nearly zero level), which is consistent with a down-regulated pattern of expression of the DAM genes in japanese pear, peach (Prunus persica), and japanese apricot (Prunus mume). Differential genomic DNA methylation patterns detected in PpMADS13–1 and PpMADS13–2 were not concomitant with seasonal endodormancy transition phases, suggesting that DNA methylation in these loci under investigation may not be linked to endodormancy progression in ‘Kosui’.

AB  - Conifers normally go through a long juvenile period, for Norway spruce (Picea abies) around 20 to 25 years, before developing male and female cones. We have grown plants from inbred crosses of a naturally occurring spruce mutant (acrocona). One-fourth of the segregating acrocona plants initiate cones already in their second growth cycle, suggesting control by a single locus. The early cone-setting properties of the acrocona mutant were utilized to identify candidate genes involved in vegetative-to-reproductive phase change in Norway spruce. Poly(A(+)) RNA samples from apical and basal shoots of cone-setting and non-cone-setting plants were subjected to high-throughput sequencing (RNA-seq). We assembled and investigated 33,383 expressed putative protein-coding acrocona transcripts. Eight transcripts were differentially expressed between selected sample pairs. One of these (Acr42124_1) was significantly up-regulated in apical shoot samples from cone-setting acrocona plants, and the encoded protein belongs to the MADS box gene family of transcription factors. Using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction with independently derived plant material, we confirmed that the MADS box gene is up-regulated in both needles and buds of cone-inducing shoots when reproductive identity is determined. Our results constitute important steps for the development of a rapid cycling model system that can be used to study gene function in conifers. In addition, our data suggest the involvement of a MADS box transcription factor in the vegetative-to-reproductive phase change in Norway spruce.

AB  - The Orchidaceae family, which is one of the most species-rich flowering plant families, includes species with highly diversified and specialized flower shapes. The aim of this study was to analyze the MADS-box genes expressed in the inflorescence of Orchis italica, a wild Mediterranean orchid species. MADS-box proteins are transcription factors involved in various plant biological processes, including flower development. In the floral tissues of O. italica, 29 MADS-box genes are expressed that are classified as both class I and II. Class I MADS-box genes include one Mbeta-type gene, thereby confirming the presence of this type of MADS-box genes in orchids. The class II MIKC* gene is highly expressed in the column, which is consistent with the conserved function of the MIKC* genes in gametophyte development. In addition, homologs of the SOC, SVP, ANR1, AGL12 and OsMADS32 genes are expressed. Compared with previous knowledge on class II MIKCC genes of O. italica involved in the ABCDE model of flower development, the number of class B and D genes has been confirmed. In addition, 4 class A (AP1/FUL) transcripts, 2 class E (SEP) transcripts, 2 new class C (AG) transcripts and 1 new AGL6 transcript have been identified. Within the AP1/FUL genes, the sequence divergence, relaxation of purifying selection and expression profiles suggest a possible functional diversification within these orchid genes. The detection of only two SEP transcripts in O. italica, in contrast with the 4 genes found in other orchids, suggests that only two SEP genes could be present in the subfamily Orchidoideae. The expression pattern of the MIKCC genes of O. italica indicates that low levels at the boundary of the domain of a given MADS-box gene can overlap with the expression of genes belonging to a different functional A-E class in the adjacent domain, thereby following a "fading borders" model.

AB  - The petunia mutant green petal (gp, line PLV) shows a homeotic effect in one floral whorl, that is, the conversion of petal to sepal. We demonstrate that this mutant contains a chromosomal deletion, including the petunia MADS box gene pMADS1. Second whorl petal development in this null mutant can be restored with a CaMV 35S-pMADS1 transgene, demonstrating the essential role of pMADS1 in this process. Because gp (PLV) shows only a minor effect on stamen development, the homeotic effects of pMADS1 are different from those of B-type genes in Antirrhinum and Arabidopsis. Two other MADS box genes, pMADS2 and fbp1 (Angenent et al. 1992), require pMADS1 to maintain expression in the second whorl. However, in the absence of pMADS1 these two genes continue to be expressed in the third whorl. The functions assigned to pMADS1 are further supported by experiments in which we phenocopy gp by cosuppression of pMADS1 gene expression. The flowers, obtained through cosuppression and phenotype restoration, display different degrees of sepal to petal conversion. Analysis of these flowers indicate that pMADS1 controls growth under the zone of petal and stamen initiation, which causes the corolla tube and stamen filaments to emerge as a congenitally fused structure.

AB  - With the aim of finding genes involved in the floral transition of woody species four MADS box genes containing cDNAs from apple (Malus domestica) have been isolated. Three genes were isolated from vegetative tissue of apple, but were homologues of known genes that specify floral organ identity. MdMADS13 is an AP3-like B class MADS box gene, and was mainly expressed in petals and stamens as demonstrated by Northern blot analysis. MdMADS14 and -15 are AGAMOUS-like genes. They differed slightly in expression patterns on Northern blots, with MdMADS15 mRNA levels equally high in stamens and carpels, but MdMADS14 preferably expressed in carpels. MdMADS14 is likely to be the apple orthologue of one of the Arabidopsis thaliana SHATTERPROOF genes, and MdMADS15 closely resembled the Arabidopsis AGAMOUS gene. It has been shown with RT-PCR that the three floral apple MADS box genes are expressed in vegetative tissues of adult as well as juvenile trees, albeit at low levels. MdMADS12 is an AP1-like gene that is expressed at similar levels in leaves, vegetative shoots, and floral tissues, and that may be involved in the transition from the juvenile to the adult stage.

AB  - How transcription factors attain their target gene specificity and how this specificity may be modulated, acquiring different regulatory functions through the development of plant tissues, is an open question. Here we characterized different regulatory roles of the MADS-domain transcription factor FRUITFULL (FUL) in flower development and mechanisms modulating its activity. We found that the dual role of FUL in regulating floral transition and pistil development is associated with its different in vivo patterns of DNA binding in both tissues. Characterization of FUL protein complexes by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and SELEX-seq experiments shows that aspects of tissue-specific target site selection can be predicted by tissue-specific variation in the composition of FUL protein complexes with different DNA binding specificities, without considering the chromatin status of the target region. This suggests a role for dynamic changes in FUL TF complex composition in reshaping the regulatory functions of FUL during flower development.

AB  - Frameshift mutations generally result in loss-of-function changes since they drastically alter the protein sequence downstream of the frameshift site, besides creating premature stop codons. Here we present data suggesting that frameshift mutations in the C-terminal domain of specific ancestral MADS-box genes may have contributed to the structural and functional divergence of the MADS-box gene family. We have identified putative frameshift mutations in the conserved C-terminal motifs of the B-function DEF/AP3 subfamily, the A-function SQUA/AP1 subfamily and the E-function AGL2 subfamily, which are all involved in the specification of organ identity during flower development. The newly evolved C-terminal motifs are highly conserved, suggesting a de novo generation of functionality. Interestingly, since the new C-terminal motifs in the A- and B-function subfamilies are only found in higher eudicotyledonous flowering plants, the emergence of these two C-terminal changes coincides with the origin of a highly standardized floral structure. We speculate that the frameshift mutations described here are examples of co-evolution of the different components of a single transcription factor complex. 3' terminal frameshift mutations might provide an important but so far unrecognized mechanism to generate novel functional C-terminal motifs instrumental to the functional diversification of transcription factor families.

AB  - We have initiated a systematic functional analysis of the MADS box, intervening region, K domain, C domain-type MADS box gene family in petunia. The starting point for this has been a reverse-genetics approach, aiming to select for transposon insertions into any MADS box gene. We have developed and applied a family signature insertion screening protocol that is highly suited for this purpose, resulting in the isolation of 32 insertion mutants in 20 different MADS box genes. In addition, we identified three more MADS box gene insertion mutants using a candidate-gene approach. The defined insertion lines provide a sound foundation for a systematic functional analysis of the MADS box gene family in petunia. Here, we focus on the analysis of Floral Binding Protein2 (FBP2) and FBP5 genes that encode the E-function, which in Arabidopsis has been shown to be required for B and C floral organ identity functions. fbp2 mutants display sepaloid petals and ectopic inflorescences originating from the third floral whorl, whereas fbp5 mutants appear as wild type. In fbp2 fbp5 double mutants, reversion of floral organs to leaf-like organs is increased further. Strikingly, ovules are replaced by leaf-like structures in the carpel, indicating that in addition to the B- and C-functions, the D-function, which specifies ovule development, requires E-function activity. Finally, we compare our data with results obtained using cosuppression approaches and conclude that the latter might be less suited for assigning functions to individual members of the MADS box gene family.

AB  - Comparative genome biology has unveiled the polyploid origin of all angiosperms and the role of recurrent polyploidization in the amplification of gene families and the structuring of genomes. Which species share certain ancient polyploidy events, and which do not, is ill defined because of the limited number of sequenced genomes and transcriptomes and their uneven phylogenetic distribution. Previously, it has been suggested that most, but probably not all, of the eudicots have shared an ancient hexaploidy event, referred to as the gamma triplication. In this study, detailed phylogenies of subfamilies of MADS-box genes suggest that the gamma triplication has occurred before the divergence of Gunnerales but after the divergence of Buxales and Trochodendrales. Large-scale phylogenetic and K(S)-based approaches on the inflorescence transcriptomes of Gunnera manicata (Gunnerales) and Pachysandra terminalis (Buxales) provide further support for this placement, enabling us to position the gamma triplication in the stem lineage of the core eudicots. This triplication likely initiated the functional diversification of key regulators of reproductive development in the core eudicots, comprising 75% of flowering plants. Although it is possible that the gamma event triggered early core eudicot diversification, our dating estimates suggest that the event occurred early in the stem lineage, well before the rapid speciation of the earliest core eudicot lineages. The evolutionary significance of this paleopolyploidy event may thus rather lie in establishing a species lineage that was resilient to extinction, but with the genomic potential for later diversification. We consider that the traits generated from this potential characterize extant core eudicots both chemically and morphologically.

AB  - We report a high-quality draft genome sequence of the domesticated apple (Malus x domestica). We show that a relatively recent (>50 million years ago) genome-wide duplication (GWD) has resulted in the transition from nine ancestral chromosomes to 17 chromosomes in the Pyreae. Traces of older GWDs partly support the monophyly of the ancestral paleohexaploidy of eudicots. Phylogenetic reconstruction of Pyreae and the genus Malus, relative to major Rosaceae taxa, identified the progenitor of the cultivated apple as M. sieversii. Expansion of gene families reported to be involved in fruit development may explain formation of the pome, a Pyreae-specific false fruit that develops by proliferation of the basal part of the sepals, the receptacle. In apple, a subclade of MADS-box genes, normally involved in flower and fruit development, is expanded to include 15 members, as are other gene families involved in Rosaceae-specific metabolism, such as transport and assimilation of sorbitol.

AB  - The genome of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) encodes over 100 MADS-domain transcription factors, categorized into five phylogenetic subgroups. Most research efforts have focused on just one of these subgroups (MIKC(c)), whereas the other four remain largely unexplored. Here, we report on five members of the so-called Mdelta or Arabidopsis MIKC* (AtMIKC*) subgroup, which are predominantly expressed during the late stages of pollen development. Very few MADS-box genes function in mature pollen, and from this perspective, the AtMIKC* genes are therefore highly exceptional. We found that the AtMIKC* proteins are able to form multiple heterodimeric complexes in planta, and that these protein complexes exhibit a for the MADS-family unusual and high DNA binding specificity in vitro. Compared to their occurrence in promoters genome wide, AtMIKC* binding sites are strongly overrepresented in the proximal region of late pollen-specific promoters. By combining our experimental data with in silico genomics and pollen transcriptomics approaches, we identified a considerable number of putative direct target genes of the AtMIKC* transcription factor complexes in pollen, many of which have known or proposed functions in pollen tube growth. The expression of several of these predicted targets is altered in mutant pollen in which all AtMIKC* complexes are affected, and in vitro germination of this mutant pollen is severely impaired. Our data therefore suggest that the AtMIKC* protein complexes play an essential role in transcriptional regulation during late pollen development.

AB  - In deciduous fruit trees in which dormancy is induced by low temperatures, the expression of DORMACY-ASSOCIATED MADS-BOX genes (DAM) is regulated by CBF/DREB1 transcription factors. In Vitis vinifera, in which dormancy is induced by the photoperiod, VvDAM-SVPs gene expression is regulated by FLOWERING LOCUS T (VvFT). Using the sequences of the six peach (Prunus persica) DORMACY-ASSOCIATED MADS-box genes (DAM) as query, eight putative DAM genes belonging to the family of MADS-box transcription factors and related to the Arabidopsis floral regulators SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) and AGAMOUS LIKE 24 (AGL24) were identified in the V. vinifera genome. Among these, five belong to the subfamily SVP-like genes which have been associated with the regulation of flowering and dormancy in annual and perennial plants, respectively. It has been proposed that they play a direct role in the induction and maintenance of endodormancy (ED) through the regulation of the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) gene. In the present study, it is demonstrated that in V. vinifera: (1) VvDAM-SVPs genes are not regulated by ABA/low temperature-induced VvCBFs transcription factors as described for other species of deciduous fruit trees. (2) A contrasting expression pattern between VvDAM3-SVP and VvFT was found under different experimental conditions related to the entry and exit of grapevine buds from ED. (3) Overexpression of VvFT in somatic grapevine embryos (SGE) repressed the expression of VvDAM3-SVP and VvDAM4-SVP. Taken together, the results suggest that VvDAM3-SVP could be associated with ED in grapevine buds, and that its expression could be regulated by VvFT.

AB  - We review functional data on MADS-box genes, recent phylogenetic analyses of these coding regions, and their roles in the development and evolution of key morphological innovations in plants. We map the origin of important morphological structures in particular diverse stages of the life cycle in different plant clades onto organismal phylogenies, and present relevant molecular genetic aspects of development related to the MADS-box genes. We focus on reproductive structures of the sporophyte because most functional characterizations have been done of MADS-box genes involved in flower development. We discuss MADS-box evolution in flowering plants, but we also review studies in the other nonflowering vascular plants, gymnosperms (conifers and gnetales), and ferns and preliminary data from the algae. We suggest that floral (e.g. flowering time, inflorescence, and flower meristem identity) MADS-box and nonfloral plant MADS-box genes should be the focus of future comparative research. Cloning and functional analyses of MADS-box genes in bryophytes, particularly in the experimental system Physcomitrella patens (Hedw.) B.S.G., are needed. The ABC model of floral organ specification is an excellent general representation of an important network of genes; however, formal analytical tools are required to integrate data on complex gene interaction in comparative analyses. This and other analytical approaches to constructing gene network models will help to frame homology hypotheses in an evolutionary and developmental framework.

Plant genomes, on the other hand, have a history of polyploidy and whole-genome duplications (WGDs), and thus, their study helps to understand whether WGDs have also had a significant influence on protein network evolution. Here we investigate the evolution of the interaction network in the well-studied MADS domain MIKC-type proteins, a TF family which plays an important role in both the vegetative and the reproductive phases of plant life. We combine phylogenetic reconstruction, protein domain analysis, and interaction data from different species. We show that, unlike previously analyzed interaction networks, the MIKC-type protein network displays a characteristic topology, with overall high inter-subfamily connectivity, shared interactors between paralogs, and conservation of interaction patterns across species. The evaluation of the number of MIKC-type proteins at key time points throughout the evolution of land plants in the lineage leading to Arabidopsis suggested that most duplicates were retained after each round of WGD. We provide evidence that an initial network, formed by 9-11 homodimerizing proteins interacting with each other, existed in the common ancestor of all seed plants. This basic structure has been conserved after each round of WGD, adding layers of paralogs with similar interaction patterns. We thus present the first model where we can show that a network of eukaryotic TFs has evolved via rounds of WGD. Furthermore, we found that in subfamilies in which the K domain is most diverged, the interactions with other subfamilies have been largely lost. We discuss the possibility that such a high proportion of genes were retained after each WGD because of their capacity to form higher order complexes involving proteins from different subfamilies. The simultaneous duplications allowed for the conservation of the quantitative balance between the constituents and facilitated sub- and neofunctionalization through differential expression of whole units.

AB  - Maturation imposes several changes in plants, which are particularly drastic in the case of trees. In recalcitrant woody species, such as chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.), one of the major maturation-related shifts is the loss of the ability to form adventitious roots in response to auxin treatment as the plant ages. To analyze the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, an in vitro model system of two different lines of microshoots derived from the same field-grown tree was established. While juvenile-like shoots root readily when treated with exogenous auxin, microshoots established from the crown of the tree rarely form roots. In the present study, a transcriptomic analysis was developed to compare the gene expression patterns in both types of shoots 24 h after hormone and wounding treatment, matching the induction phase of the process. Our results support the hypothesis that the inability of adult chestnut tissues to respond to the inductive treatment relies in a deep change of gene expression imposed by maturation that results in a significant transcriptome modification. Differences in phytohormone signaling seem to be the main cause for the recalcitrant behavior of mature shoots, with abscisic acid and ethylene negatively influencing the rooting ability of the chestnut plants. We have identified a set of related MADS-box genes whose expression is modified but not suppressed by the inductive treatment in mature shoots, suggesting a putative link of their activity with the rooting-recalcitrant behavior of this material. Overall, distinct maturation-derived auxin sensibility and homeostasis, and the related modifications in the balance with other phytohormones, seem to govern the outcome of the process in each type of shoots.

AB  - Temperate perennials require exposure to chilling temperatures to resume growth in the following spring. Growth and dormancy cycles are controlled by complex genetic regulatory networks and are governed by epigenetic mechanisms, but the specific genes and mechanisms remain poorly understood. To understand how seasonal changes and chilling regulate dormancy and growth in the woody perennial vine kiwifruit (Ac, Actinidia chinensis), a transcriptome study of kiwifruit buds in the field and controlled conditions was performed. A MADS-box gene with homology to Arabidopsis FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) was identified and characterized. Elevated expression of AcFLC-like (AcFLCL) was detected during bud dormancy and chilling. A long noncoding (lnc) antisense transcript with an expression pattern opposite to AcFLCL and shorter sense noncoding RNAs were identified. Chilling induced an increase in trimethylation of lysine-4 of histone H3 (H3K4me3) in the 5' end of the gene, indicating multiple layers of epigenetic regulation in response to cold. Overexpression of AcFLCL in kiwifruit gave rise to plants with earlier budbreak, whilst gene editing using CRISPR-Cas9 resulted in transgenic lines with substantially delayed budbreak, suggesting a role in activation of growth. These results have implications for the future management and breeding of perennials for resilience to changing climate.

AB  - Tomato plants harboring the ripening-inhibitor (rin) mutation yield fruits that fail to ripen. Additionally, rin plants display enlarged sepals and loss of inflorescence determinacy. Positional cloning of the rin locus revealed two tandem MADS-box genes (LeMADS-RIN and LeMADS-MC), whose expression patterns suggested roles in fruit ripening and sepal development, respectively. The rin mutation alters expression of both genes. Gene repression and mutant complementation demonstrate that LeMADS-RIN regulates ripening, whereas LeMADS-MC affects sepal development and inflorescence determinacy. LeMADS-RIN demonstrates an agriculturally important function of plant MADS-box genes and provides molecular insight into nonhormonal (developmental) regulation of ripening.

AB  - Arabidopsis root architecture is highly responsive to changes in the nitrogen supply. External NO(3)(-) stimulates lateral root growth via a signalling pathway involving the ANR1 MADS box transcription factor, while the presence of exogenous l-glutamate (Glu) at the primary root tip slows primary root growth and stimulates root branching. We have found that NO(3)(-), in conjunction with Glu, has a hitherto unrecognized role in regulating the growth of primary roots. Nitrate was able to stimulate primary root growth, both directly and by antagonising the inhibitory effect of Glu. Each response depended on direct contact between the primary root tip and the NO(3)(-), and was not elicited by an alternative N source (NH(4)(+)). The chl1-5 mutant, which is defective in the NRT1.1 (CHL1) NO(3)(-) transporter, was insensitive to NO(3)(-) antagonism of Glu signalling, while an anr1 mutant retained its sensitivity. Sensitivity to NO(3)(-) was restored in a chl1-5 mutant constitutively expressing NRT1.1. However, expression in chl1-5 of a transport-competent but non-phosphorylatable form of NRT1.1 not only failed to restore NO(3)(-) sensitivity but also had a dominant-negative effect on Glu sensitivity. Our results indicate the existence of a NO(3)(-) signalling pathway at the primary root tip that can antagonise the root's response to Glu, and they further suggest that NRT1.1 has a direct NO(3)(-) sensing role in this pathway. We discuss how the observed signalling interactions between NO(3)(-) and Glu could provide a mechanism for modulating root architecture in response to changes in the relative abundance of organic and inorganic N.

AB  - Postzygotic lethality of interspecies hybrids can result from differences in gene expression, copy number, or coding sequence and can be overcome by altering parental genome dosage. In crosses between Arabidopsis thaliana and A. arenosa, embryo arrest is associated with endosperm hyperproliferation and delayed development similar to paternal-excess interploidy crosses and polycomb-repressive complex (PRC) mutants. Failure is accompanied by parent-specific loss of gene silencing including the dysregulation of three genes suppressed by PRC. Increasing the maternal genome dosage rescues seed development and gene silencing. A gene set upregulated in the failing seed transcriptome encoded putative AGAMOUS-LIKE MADS domain transcription factors (AGL) that were expressed in normal early endosperm and were shown to interact in a previous yeast 2-hybrid analysis. Suppression of these AGL's expression upon cellularization required PRC. Preceding seed failure, expression of the PRC member FIS2 decreased concomitant with overexpression of the AGL cluster. Inactivating two members, AGL62 and AGL90, attenuated the postzygotic barrier between A. thaliana and A. arenosa. We present a model where dosage-sensitive loss of PRC function results in a dysregulated AGL network, which is detrimental for early seed development.

AB  - The distribution of elite soybean (Glycine max) cultivars is limited due to their highly sensitive to photoperiod, which affects the flowering time and plant architecture. The recent emergence of CRISPR/Cas9 technology has uncovered new opportunities for genetic manipulation of soybean. The major maturity gene E1 of soybean plays a critical role in soybean photoperiod response. Here, we performed CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeted mutation of E1 gene in soybean cultivar Tianlong1 carrying the dominant E1 to investigate its precise function in photoperiod regulation, especially in plant architecture regulation. Four types of mutations in the E1 coding region were generated. No off-target effects were observed, and homozygous trans-clean mutants without T-DNA were obtained. The photoperiod sensitivity of e1 mutants decreased relative to the wild type plants; however, e1 mutants still responded to photoperiod. Further analysis revealed that the homologs of E1, E1-La, and E1-Lb, were up-regulated in the e1 mutants, indicating a genetic compensation response of E1 and its homologs. The e1 mutants exhibited significant changes in the architecture, including initiation of terminal flowering, formation of determinate stems, and decreased branch numbers. To identify E1-regulated genes related to plant architecture, transcriptome deep sequencing (RNA-seq) was used to compare the gene expression profiles in the stem tip of the wild-type soybean cultivar and the e1 mutants. The expression of shoot identity gene Dt1 was significantly decreased, while Dt2 was significantly upregulated. Also, a set of MADS-box genes was up-regulated in the stem tip of e1 mutants which might contribute to the determinate stem growth habit.

AB  - Longan (Dimocarpus longan Lour.) is an important economic crop widely planted in tropical and subtropical regions, and flower and fruit development play decisive effects on the longan yield and fruit quality formation. MCM1, AGAMOUS, DEFICIENS, Serum Response Factor (MADS)-box transcription factor family plays important roles for the flowering time, floral organ identity, and fruit development in plants. However, there is no systematic information of MADS-box family in longan. In this study, 114 MADS-box genes were identified from the longan genome, phylogenetic analysis divided them into type I (Malpha, Mbeta, Mgamma) and type II (MIKC*, MIKC (C) ) groups, and MIKC (C) genes were further clustered into 12 subfamilies. Comparative genomic analysis of 12 representative plant species revealed the conservation of type II in Sapindaceae and analysis of cis-elements revealed that Dof transcription factors might directly regulate the MIKC (C) genes. An ABCDE model was proposed for longan based on the phylogenetic analysis and expression patterns of MADS-box genes. Transcriptome analysis revealed that MIKC (C) genes showed wide expression spectrums, particularly in reproductive organs. From 35 days after KClO(3) treatment, 11 MIKC genes were up-regulated, suggesting a crucial role in off-season flower induction, while DlFLC, DlSOC1, DlSVP, and DlSVP-LIKE may act as the inhibitors. The gene expression patterns of longan fruit development indicated that DlSTK, DlSEP1/2, and DlMADS53 could be involved in fruit growth and ripening. This paper carried out the whole genome identification and analysis of the longan MADS-box family for the first time, which provides new insights for further understanding its function in flowers and fruit.

AB  - Optimal inflorescence architecture is important for plant reproductive success by affecting the ultimate number of flowers that set fruits and for plant competitiveness when interacting with biotic or abiotic conditions. The pedicel is one of the key contributors to inflorescence architecture diversity. To date, knowledge about the molecular mechanisms of pedicel development is derived from Arabidopsis. Not much is known regarding other plants. Here, an SVP family MADS-box gene, NtSVP, in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) that is required for pedicel elongation was identified. It is shown that knockdown of NtSVP by RNA interference (RNAi) caused elongated pedicels, while overexpression resulted in compact inflorescences with much shortened pedicels. Moreover, an Arabidopsis BREVIPEDECELLUS/KNAT1 homologue NtBP-Like (NtBPL) was significantly up-regulated in NtSVP-RNAi plants. Disruption of NtBPL decreased pedicel lengths and shortened cortex cells. Consistent with the presence of a CArG-box at the NtBPL promoter, the direct binding of NtSVP to the NtBPL promoter was demonstrated by yeast one-hybrid assay, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and dual-luciferase assay, in which NtSVP may act as a repressor of NtBPL. Microarray analysis showed that down-regulation of NtBPL resulted in differential expression of genes associated with a number of hormone biogenesis and signalling genes such as those for auxin and gibberellin. These findings together suggest the function of a MADS-box transcription factor in plant pedicel development, probably via negative regulation of a BP-like class I KNOX gene. The present work thus postulates the conservation and divergence of the molecular regulatory pathways underlying the development of plant inflorescence architecture.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cunninghamia lanceolata (Chinese fir), a member of the conifer family Cupressaceae, is one of the most popular cultivated trees for wood production in China. Continuous research is being performed to improve C. lanceolata breeding values. Given the high rate of seed abortion (one of the reasons being the failure of ovule and pollen development) in C. lanceolata, the proper formation of female/male cones could theoretically increase the number of offspring in future generations. MIKC MADS-box genes are well-known for their roles in the flower/cone development and comprise the typical/atypical floral development model for both angiosperms and gymnosperms. RESULTS: We performed a transcriptomic analysis to find genes differentially expressed between female and male cones at a single, carefully determined developmental stage, focusing on the MIKC MADS-box genes. We finally obtained 47 unique MIKC MADS-box genes from C. lanceolata and divided these genes into separate branches. 27 out of the 47 MIKC MADS-box genes showed differential expression between female and male cones, and most of them were not expressed in leaves. Out of these 27 genes, most B-class genes (AP3/PI) were up-regulated in the male cone, while TM8 genes were up-regulated in the female cone. Then, with no obvious overall preference for AG (class C + D) genes in female/male cones, it seems likely that these genes are involved in the development of both cones. Finally, a small number of genes such as GGM7, SVP, AGL15, that were specifically expressed in female/male cones, making them candidate genes for sex-specific cone development. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified a number of MIKC MADS-box genes showing differential expression between female and male cones in C. lanceolata, illustrating a potential link of these genes with C. lanceolata cone development. On the basis of this, we postulated a possible cone development model for C. lanceolata. The gene expression library showing differential expression between female and male cones shown here, can be used to discover unknown regulatory networks related to sex-specific cone development in the future.

AB  - Phytochromes play vital roles in the regulation of flowering time, but little is known in Panicoideae species, especially the C(4) model Setaria. Here, genomic variations of PHYTOCHROME C (PHYC) between wild and cultivated Setaria gene pools were analysed and three SiphyC mutants were identified. The function of SiPHYC was verified by CRISPR-Cas9 approach and transcriptome sequencing. Furthermore, efficiency of indoor cultivation of SiphyC mutants were systematically evaluated. An extreme purified selection of PHYC was detected in wild to cultivated domestication process of Setaria. SiphyC mutants and knockout transgenic plants showed an early heading date and a loss of response to short-day photoperiod. Furthermore, variable expression of SiFTa, SiMADS14 and SiMADS15 might be responsible for promoting flowering of SiphyC mutants. Moreover, SiphyC mutant was four times that of the indoor plot ratio of wild-type and produced over 200 seeds within 45 d per individual. Our results suggest that domestication-associated SiPHYC repressed flowering and determined Setaria as a short-day plant, and SiphyC mutants possess the potential for creating efficient indoor cultivation system suitable for research on Setaria as a model, and either for maize or sorghum as well.

AB  - Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs) play crucial roles in transcriptional repression and developmental regulation in both plants and animals. In plants, depletion of different members of PRCs causes both overlapping and unique phenotypic defects. However, the underlying molecular mechanism determining the target specificity and functional diversity is not sufficiently characterized. Here, we quantitatively compared changes of tri-methylation at H3K27 in Arabidopsis mutants deprived of various key PRC components. We show that CURLY LEAF (CLF), a major catalytic subunit of PRC2, coordinates with different members of PRC1 in suppression of distinct plant developmental programs. We found that expression of flower development genes is repressed in seedlings preferentially via non-redundant role of CLF, which specifically associated with LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN1 (LHP1). In contrast, expression of embryo development genes is repressed by PRC1-catalytic core subunits AtBMI1 and AtRING1 in common with PRC2-catalytic enzymes CLF or SWINGER (SWN). This context-dependent role of CLF corresponds well with the change in H3K27me3 profiles, and is remarkably associated with differential co-occupancy of binding motifs of transcription factors (TFs), including MADS box and ABA-related factors. We propose that different combinations of PRC members distinctively regulate different developmental programs, and their target specificity is modulated by specific TFs.

AB  - The FT gene integrates several external and endogenous cues controlling flowering, including information on day length. A complex of the mobile FT protein and the bZIP transcription factor FD in turn has a central role in activating genes that execute the switch from vegetative to reproductive development. Here we reveal that microRNA156-targeted SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE (SPL) genes not only act downstream of FT/FD, but also define a separate endogenous flowering pathway. High levels of miR156 in young plants prevent precocious flowering. A subsequent day length-independent decline in miR156 abundance provides a permissive environment for flowering and is paralleled by a rise in SPL levels. At the shoot apex, FT/FD and SPLs converge on an overlapping set of targets, with SPLs directly activating flower-promoting MADS box genes, providing a molecular substrate for both the redundant activities and the feed-forward action of the miR156/SPL and FT/FD modules in flowering control.

AB  - Flowering is a crucial process for plants that is under complex genetic control. AP1 acts as an organizer and a switch for the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth. In our previous study, we found that overexpression of BpAP1 significantly promoted the formation of male inflorescence in birch (Betula platyphlla x B. pendula). In this study, we aimed at investigating the molecular regulatory mechanism of BpAP1 during the process of male inflorescence formation in birch. We found that overexpression of BpAP1 affected the expression of many flowering-related genes, and had significant effect on B class MADS-box genes. A BpAP1-mediated gene regulatory network was constructed and B class gene BpDEF was finally predicted as a key target gene of BpAP1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation results indicated that BpAP1 could directly regulate BpDEF during the process of male inflorescence formation. Yeast one-hybrid assays and its validation in tobacco results suggested that BpAP1 regulated BpDEF via binding to a consensus DNA sequence known as CArG box. Gene function analysis of BpDEF indicated that BpDEF may function in sex-determination, and in particular specify the identity of male inflorescence in birch. Our results provide valuable clues for our understanding of the molecular mechanism of BpAP1 during the process of male inflorescence formation in birch.

AB  - The tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) protein MADS-RIN plays important roles in fruit ripening. In this study, the functions of two homologous tomato proteins, FUL1 and FUL2, which contain conserved MIKC domains that typify plant MADS-box proteins, and which interact with MADS-RIN, were analysed. Transgenic functional analysis showed that FUL1 and FUL2 function redundantly in fruit ripening regulation, but exhibit distinct roles in the regulation of cellular differentiation and expansion. Over-expression of FUL2 in tomato resulted in a pointed tip at the blossom end of the fruit, together with a thinner pericarp, reduced stem diameter, and smaller leaves, but no obvious phenotypes resulted from FUL1 over-expression. Dual suppression of FUL1 and FUL2 substantially inhibited fruit ripening by blocking ethylene biosynthesis and decreasing carotenoid accumulation. In addition, the levels of transcript corresponding to ACC SYNTHASE2 (ACS2), which plays a key role in ethylene biosynthesis, were significantly decreased in the FUL1/FUL2 knock-down tomato fruits. Overall, our results suggest that FUL proteins can regulate tomato fruit ripening through fine-tuning ethylene biosynthesis and the expression of ripening-related genes.

AB  - The orchid floral organs represent novel and effective structures for attracting pollination vectors. In addition, to avoid inbreeding, the androecium and gynoecium are united in a single structure termed the gynostemium. Identification of C-class MADS-box genes regulating reproductive organ development could help determine the level of homology with the current ABC model of floral organ identity in orchids. In this study, we isolated and characterized two C-class AGAMOUS-like genes, denoted CeMADS1 and CeMADS2, from Cymbidium ensifolium. These two genes showed distinct spatial and temporal expression profiles, which suggests their functional diversification during gynostemium development. Furthermore, the expression of CeMADS1 but not CeMADS2 was eliminated in the multitepal mutant whose gynostemium is replaced by a newly emerged flower, and this ecotopic flower continues to produce sepals and petals centripetally. Protein interaction relationships among CeMADS1, CeMADS2 and E-class PeMADS8 proteins were assessed by yeast two-hybrid analysis. Both CeMADS1 and CeMADS2 formed homodimers and heterodimers with each other and the E-class PeMADS protein. Furthermore, transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing CeMADS1 or CeMADS2 showed limited growth of primary inflorescence. Thus, CeMADS1 may have a pivotal C function in reproductive organ development in C. ensifolium.

AB  - Identification and understanding of the genetic basis of natural variations in plants are essential for comprehending their phenotypic adaptation. Here, we report a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) expression in 727 Arabidopsis accessions. We identified B LYMPHOMA MOLONEY MURINE LEUKEMIA VIRUS INSERTION REGION 1 HOMOLOG 1A (BMI1A) as a causal gene for one of the FLC expression quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Loss of function in BMI1A increases FLC expression and delays flowering time at 16 degrees C significantly compared with the wild type (Col-0). BMI1A activity is required for histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) accumulation at the FLC, MADS AFFECTING FLOWERING 4 (MAF4), and MAF5 loci at low ambient temperature. We further uncovered two BMI1A haplotypes associated with the natural variation in FLC expression and flowering time at 16 degrees C, and demonstrated that polymorphisms in the BMI1A promoter region are the main contributor. Different BMI1A haplotypes are strongly associated with geographical distribution, and the low ambient temperature-sensitive BMI1A variants are associated with a lower mean temperature of the driest quarter of their collection sites compared with the temperature-non-responsive variants, indicating that the natural variations in BMI1A have adaptive functions in FLC expression and flowering time regulation. Therefore, our results provide new insights into the natural variations in FLC expression and flowering time diversity in plants.

AB  - Acacia mangium Willd. is a legume tree species native to subtropical and tropical regions of Asia and Australia. Many features of its flower development are common to other legume tree species. To identify genes involved in its floral development, we constructed a subtractive flower cDNA library against vegetative tissues. The 1123 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) represented 576 unique genes. Macroarray analysis further identified 147 of these genes as specific to the early, late or whole flowering process. Eight percent of these flower-specific genes encode MADS-domain-containing transcription factors and MYB proteins. Four percent encode other transcription factors and 10% encode regulatory proteins such as G proteins, kinases and phosphatases. Flower-specific transcripts for gibberellic acid (GA) synthesis and GA-induced proteins, as well as other stress- and pathogenesis-related genes (9%), implicate their involvement in A. mangium flower development. Eighteen percent of the flower-specific genes encode hypothetical proteins and 18% encode proteins of unknown functions. The RNA blot hybridization confirmed and detailed the expression patterns of selected genes. Functions of the A. mangium flower-specific genes are discussed based on comparison with their Arabidopsis homologues, most of which have been implicated in Arabidopsis floral development. Our work suggests general conservation of floral development in A. mangium and Arabidopsis. Further characterization of the conserved and different flower-specific genes will delineate the flowering process of this important legume tree species and facilitate genetic modification of its reproduction.

AB  - Delay of floral transition is a valuable trait in commercially important turfgrass species. It has been reported that short vegetative phase (SVP)-like proteins, potential repressors of the floral inductive pathway, control the transition from vegetative to reproductive phase. A homolog of SVP-like genes was isolated from tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and 3′-RACE and designated as F. arundinacea VEGETATIVE TO REPRODUCTIVE TRANSITION gene-2 (FaVRT-2). It encodes a putative protein of 226 amino acids with a conserved MADS (M) domain, a Keratin-like (K) domain, and a C-terminal (C) domain. Phylogenetic analysis showed that FaVRT-2 is most closely related to VRT-2 proteins from ryegrass, barley, and wheat and belongs to the StMADS11 subfamily of MADS-box transcription factors. Subcellular localization showed that the FaVRT-2 protein accumulates in the nucleus suggesting a role as trans acting factor. FaVRT-2 transcripts accumulate abundantly in roots and stems and is moderately present in leaves under normal conditions (without non-vernalization treatment). Real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed similar transcriptional patterns of FaVRT-2 under both vernalization and non-vernalization conditions. However, the peak of FaVRT-2 transcripts under vernalization condition occurred 14 days earlier than that found under non-vernalization condition. These results support the hypothesis that FaVRT-2, a putative repressor of floral transition, is regulated by vernalization in tall fescue.

AB  - Orchids (members of the Orchidaceae family) possess unique flower morphology and adaptive reproduction strategies. Although the mechanisms underlying their perianth development have been intensively studied, the molecular basis of reproductive organ development in orchids remains largely unknown. Here, we report the identification and functional characterization of two AGAMOUS (AG)-like MADS-box genes, Dendrobium 'Orchid' AG1 (DOAG1) and DOAG2, which are putative C- and D-class genes, respectively, from the orchid Dendrobium 'Chao Praya Smile'. Both DOAG1 and DOAG2 are highly expressed in the reproductive organ, known as the column, compared to perianth organs, while DOAG2 expression gradually increases in pace with pollination-induced ovule development and is localized in ovule primordia. Ectopic expression of DOAG1, but not DOAG2, rescues floral defects in the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) ag-4 mutant, including reiteration of stamenoid perianth organs in inner whorls and complete loss of carpels. Downregulation of DOAG1 and DOAG2 in orchids by artificial microRNA interference using l-Met sulfoximine selection-based gene transformation systems shows that both genes are essential for specifying reproductive organ identity, yet they, exert different roles in mediating floral meristem determinacy and ovule development, respectively, in Dendrobium spp. orchids. Notably, knockdown of DOAG1 and DOAG2 also affects perianth organ development in orchids. Our findings suggest that DOAG1 and DOAG2 not only act as evolutionarily conserved C- and D-class genes, respectively, in determining reproductive organ identity, but also play hitherto unknown roles in mediating perianth organ development in orchids.

AB  - The phenomenon of multi-carpel and multi-ovule exists in the grapevine cultivar 'Xiangfei', but the mechanism of ovule formation is seldom reported. In this study, we observed the ovule formation process by using 'Xiangfei' grapes. The role of the VvAG2 (VvAGAMOUS) gene in ovule formation was identified, and we explored the relationship between VvAG2, VvSEP3(VvMADS4) and VvAGL11(VvMADS5) proteins. The results showed that the ovule primordium appeared when the inflorescence length of 'Xiangfei' grapes were 4-5 cm long; the relative expression levels of VvAG2, VvAGL11 and VvSEP3 genes were higher during ovule formation, and the expression levels of VvAG2 gene was the highest. Transgenic tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) plants expressing VvAG2 produced higher numbers of ovules and carpels than the wild type. Moreover, yeast two-hybrid and yeast three-hybrid experiments demonstrated that VvSEP3 acts as a bridge and interacts with VvAG2 and VvAGL11 proteins, respectively. Meanwhile, a homodimer can be formed between VvSEP3 and VvSEP3, but there was no interaction between VvAG2 and VvAGL11. These findings suggest that the VvAG2 gene is involved in the formation of ovules, and VvAG2/VvSEP3 together with VvAGL11/VvSEP3 can form a tetrameric complex. In summary, our data showed that VvAG2 along with VvSEP3 and VvAGL11 jointly regulate the ovule formation of 'Xiangfei' grapes.

AB  - EgMADS16, one of the MADS-box transcription factors in oil palm, has a high expression level in the late fruit development of the oil palm fruit mesocarp. At the same time, it is also predicted to be the target gene of EgmiR5179, which has been identified in previous research. In this paper, we focused on the function and regulatory mechanism of the EgMADS16 gene in oil palm lipid metabolism. The results indicated that the transcription level of EgMADS16 was highest in the fourth stage, and a dual-luciferase reporter assay proved that the EgMADS16 expression level was downregulated by EgmiR5179. In both the OXEgMADS16 Arabidopsis seeds and oil palm embryonic calli, the total lipid contents were significantly decreased, but the contents of C18:0 and C18:3 in OXEgMADS16 lines were significantly increased. As expected, EgmiR5179 weakened the inhibitory effect of EgMADS16 on the oil contents in transgenic Arabidopsis plants that coexpressed EgmiR5179 and EgMADS16 (OXEgmiR5179-EgMADS16). Moreover, yeast two-hybrid and BiFC analyses suggested that there was an interaction between the EgMADS16 protein and EgGLO1 protein, which had been proven to be capable of regulating fatty acid synthesis in our previous research work. In summary, a model of the molecular mechanism by which miRNA5179 targets EgMADS16 to regulate oil biosynthesis was hypothesized, and the research results provide new insight into lipid accumulation and molecular regulation in oil palm.

AB  - Fruit yield is the most important horticultural trait of tomato. SlMBP21, a SEPALLATA subclass MADS-box gene has been reported to have functions in regulating pedicel abscission zone identity and development and controlling sepal size in tomato. However, we generated transgenic tomato plants which overexpress SlMBP21 and found the transformants displayed curly leaves, abnormally shaped flowers with twisted and opened stamens, reduced yield parameters, and small and light seeds. Our studies on the gain-of-function phenotype and gene expression level showed that its novel aspects played important roles in determining leaf morphology, flower and inflorescence architecture, and seed size, as well as the fruit yield. Overexpression of SlMBP21 in tomato resulted in curly leaves with fewer leaflets due to the regulation of the critical leaf polarity genes that cause an imbalance between the midvein adaxial–abaxial cell growth. Defects in the architecture of flowers and inflorescences resulted in reduced fruit set. Furthermore, we demonstrated that SlMBP21 plays its role through inhibiting the expression of the genes involved in the determination of seed development in tomato and SlMBP21 protein can interact with other MADS-box protein (SlAGL11, TAGL1 and SlMBP3) to control seed size. Thus, these results suggest that overexpression of SlMBP21 causes multiple types of damage to plant growth and development, especially fruit yield, in tomato.

AB  - Chloroplasts convert solar energy into biologically useful forms of energy by performing photosynthesis. Although light and particular genes are known to promote chloroplast development, little is known about the mechanisms that regulate the tissue-specificity and cell-specificity of chloroplast biogenesis. Thus, the mechanisms that determine whether non-photosynthetic plastids rather than chloroplasts develop in petals remain largely unexplored. Although heat stress is known to inhibit photosynthesis, we do not know whether heat stress affects chloroplast biogenesis. Here, we report that heat stress up-regulates the expression of chlorophyll biosynthesis-related genes and promotes chloroplasts biogenesis in petals overexpressing SOC1 (suppressor of overexpression of CO) and novel SOC1-like genes. We also found that these specific MADS-box transcription factors are present in most photosynthetic eukaryotes and that the expression of more than one homolog is observed in chloroplast-containing tissues. These findings not only provide novel insights into the tissue specificity of chloroplast biogenesis and a method for producing green petals but also are consistent with heat stress influencing chloroplast biogenesis in higher plants.

AB  - Cultivated chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum x morifolium Ramat.) is a beloved ornamental crop due to the diverse capitula types among varieties, but the molecular mechanism of capitulum development remains unclear. Here, we report a 2.60 Gb chromosome-scale reference genome of C. lavandulifolium, a wild Chrysanthemum species found in China, Korea and Japan. The evolutionary analysis of the genome revealed that only recent tandem duplications occurred in the C. lavandulifolium genome after the shared whole genome triplication (WGT) in Asteraceae. Based on the transcriptomic profiling of six important developmental stages of the radiate capitulum in C. lavandulifolium, we found genes in the MADS-box, TCP, NAC and LOB gene families that were involved in disc and ray floret primordia differentiation. Notably, NAM and LOB30 homologs were specifically expressed in the radiate capitulum, suggesting their pivotal roles in the genetic network of disc and ray floret primordia differentiation in chrysanthemum. The present study not only provides a high-quality reference genome of chrysanthemum but also provides insight into the molecular mechanism underlying the diverse capitulum types in chrysanthemum.

AB  - The evolutionary origin of the angiosperms (flowering plants sensu stricto) is still enigmatic. Answers to the question of angiosperm origins are intimately connected to the identification of their sister group among extinct and extant taxa. Most phylogenetic analyses based on morphological data agree that among the groups of extant seed plants, the gnetophytes are the sister group of the angiosperms. According to this view, angiosperms and gnetophytes are the only extant members of a clade called "anthophytes" to emphasize their shared possession of flower-like reproductive structures. However, most phylogeny reconstructions based on molecular data so far did not support an anthophyte clade, but also could not clarify the case because support for alternative groupings has been weak or controversial. We have isolated 13 different homologs of MADS-type floral homeotic genes from the gnetophyte Gnetum gnemon. Five of these genes fall into monophyletic gene clades also comprising putatively orthologous genes from flowering plants and conifers, among them orthologs of floral homeotic B and C function genes. Within these clades the Gnetum genes always form distinct subclades together with the respective conifer genes, to the exclusion of the angiosperm genes. This provides strong molecular evidence for a sister-group relationship between gnetophytes and conifers, which is in contradiction to widely accepted interpretations of morphological data for almost a century. Our phylogeny reconstructions and the outcome of expression studies suggest that complex features such as flower-like reproductive structures and double-fertilization arose independently in gnetophytes and angiosperms.

AB  - Organisms can rapidly mitigate the effects of environmental changes by changing their phenotypes, known as phenotypic plasticity. Yet, little is known about the temperature-mediated plasticity of traits that are directly linked to plant fitness such as flower size. We discovered substantial genetic variation in flower size plasticity to temperature both among selfing Arabidopsis thaliana and outcrossing A. arenosa individuals collected from a natural growth habitat. Genetic analysis using a panel of 290 A. thaliana accession and mutant lines revealed that MADS AFFECTING FLOWERING (MAF) 2-5 gene cluster, previously shown to regulate temperature-mediated flowering time, was associated to the flower size plasticity to temperature. Furthermore, our findings pointed that the control of plasticity differs from control of the trait itself. Altogether, our study advances the understanding of genetic and molecular factors underlying plasticity on fundamental fitness traits, such as flower size, in response to future climate scenarios.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The classical (C) MIKC-type MADS-box transcription factors comprise one gene family that plays diverse roles in the flowering process ranging from floral initiation to the development of floral organs. Despite their importance in regulating developmental processes that impact crop yield, they remain largely unexplored in the major legume oilseed crop, soybean. RESULTS: We identified 57 MIKC(c)-type transcription factors from soybean and determined the in silico gene expression profiles of the soybean MIKC(c)-type genes across different tissues. Our study implicates three MIKC(c)-type transcription factors as novel members of the AGAMOUS LIKE 6 (AGL6) subfamily of the MIKC(C)-type MADS-box genes, and we named this sister clade PsMADS3. While similar genes were identified in other legume species, poplar and grape, no such gene is represented in Arabidopsis thaliana or rice. RT-PCR analysis on these three soybean PsMADS3 genes during early floral initiation processes revealed their temporal expression similar to that of APETALA1, a gene known to function as a floral meristem identity gene. However, RNA in situ hybridisation showed that their spatial expression patterns are markedly different from those of APETALA1. CONCLUSION: Legume flower development system differs from that in the model plant, Arabidopsis. There is an overlap in the initiation of different floral whorls in soybean, and inflorescent meristems can revert to leaf production depending on the environmental conditions. MIKC(C)-type MADS-box genes have been shown to play key regulatory roles in different stages of flower development. We identified members of the PsMADS3 sub-clade in legumes that show differential spatial expression during floral initiation, indicating their potential novel roles in the floral initiation process. The results from this study will contribute to a better understanding of legume-specific floral developmental processes.

AB  - MADS-box transcription factors (TFs) play indispensable roles in various aspects of plant growth, development as well as in response to environmental stresses. Several MADS-box genes have been reported to be involved in the salt tolerance in different plant species. However, the role of the transcription factor OsMADS57 under salinity stress is still unknown. Here, the results of this study showed that OsMADS57 was mainly expressed in roots and leaves of rice plants (Oryza sativa). Gene expression pattern analysis revealed that OsMADS57 was induced by NaCl. Overexpression of OsMADS57 in both Arabidopsis thaliana (A. thaliana) and rice could improve their salt tolerance, which was demonstrated by higher germination rates, longer root length and better growth status of overexpression plants than wild type (WT) under salinity conditions. In contrast, RNA interference (RNAi) lines of rice showed more sensitivity towards salinity. Moreover, less reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulated in OsMADS57 overexpressing lines when exposed to salt stress, as measured by 3, 3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) or nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) staining. Further experiments exhibited that overexpression of OsMADS57 in rice significantly increased the tolerance ability of plants to oxidative damage under salt stress, mainly by increasing the activities of antioxidative enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD), reducing malonaldehyde (MDA) content and improving the expression of stress-related genes. Taken together, these results demonstrated that OsMADS57 plays a positive role in enhancing salt tolerance by activating the antioxidant system.

AB  - Grain weight, a crucial trait that determines the grain yield in rice, is influenced by grain size. Although a series of regulators that control grain size have been identified in rice, the mechanisms underlying grain development are not yet well understood. In this study, we identified OsPUB43, a U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase, as an important negative regulator determining the gain size and grain weight in rice. Phenotypes of large grain are observed in ospub43 mutants, whereas overexpression of OsPUB43 results in short grains. Scanning electron microscopy analysis reveals that OsPUB43 modulates the grain size mainly by inhibiting cell proliferation in the spikelet hull. The OsPUB43 protein is localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus. The ospub43 mutants display high sensitivity to exogenous BR, while OsPUB43-OE lines are hyposensitive to BR. Furthermore, the transient transcriptional activity assay shows that OsBZR1 can activate the expression of OsPUB43. Collectively, our results indicate that OsPUB43 negatively controls the gain size by modulating the expression of BR-responsive genes as well as MADS-box genes that are required for lemma/palea specification, suggesting that OsPUB43 has a potential valuable application in the enlargement of grain size in rice.

AB  - DORMANCY-ASSOCIATED MADS-box (DAM) and SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) genes have been implicated in the regulation of winter dormancy in perennials. Ectopic expression of apple (Malus x domestica Borkh. 'Royal Gala') DAM and SVP genes delays budbreak and constrains lateral shoot outgrowth. In this study, we used RNA interference (RNAi) to simultaneously target all apple DAM and SVP genes in order to study their role and mode of action in the regulation of bud dormancy, budbreak and flowering. A synthetic construct carrying a hairpin fragment assembled from sequences specific to coding regions of three DAM and two SVP genes was used to generate transgenic lines. Reduced expression of DAM/SVP genes resulted in delayed leaf senescence and abscission in autumn, failure to enter bud dormancy in winter and continual growth of new leaves regardless of the season for over 3 years. Precocious flowering but normal flower morphology, fertility and fruit development were observed. The non-dormant phenotype was associated with modified phytohormone composition. The content of gibberellins (GAs) and jasmonates (JAs) was significantly increased in terminal buds of RNAi lines compared with wildtype plants, accompanied by elevated expression of the key GA biosynthesis pathway gene GIBBERELLIN 20 OXIDASE-2 (MdGA20ox-2) along with the FLOWERING LOCUS T gene MdFT2. The key mediator of plasmodesmatal closure, MdCALLOSE SYNTHASE 1 (MdCALS1), was repressed in RNAi lines. This study provides functional evidence for the role of DAM/SVP genes in vegetative phenology of apple and paves the way for production of low-chill varieties suitable for growth in warming climates.

AB  - The annual growth cycle of trees is the result of seasonal cues. The onset of winter triggers an endodormant state preventing bud growth and, once a chilling requirement is satisfied, these buds enter an ecodormant state and resume growing. MADS-box genes with similarity to Arabidopsis SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) [the SVP-like and DORMANCY ASSOCIATED MADS-BOX (DAM) genes] have been implicated in regulating flowering and growth-dormancy cycles in perennials. Here, we identified and characterized three DAM-like (MdDAMs) and two SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE-like (MdSVPs) genes from apple (Malus x domestica 'Royal Gala'). The expression of MdDAMa and MdDAMc indicated they may play a role in triggering autumn growth cessation. In contrast, the expression of MdDAMb, MdSVPa and MdSVPb suggested a role in maintaining bud dormancy. Consistent with this, ectopic expression of MdDAMb and MdSVPa in 'Royal Gala' apple plants resulted in delayed budbreak and architecture change due to constrained lateral shoot outgrowth, but normal flower and fruit development. The association of MdSVPa and MdSVPb expression with floral bud development in the low fruiting 'Off' trees of a biennial bearing cultivar 'Sciros' suggested the SVP genes might also play a role in floral meristem identity.

AB  - MADS-box genes similar to Arabidopsis SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) have been implicated in the regulation of flowering in annual species and bud dormancy in perennial species. Kiwifruit (Actinidia spp.) are woody perennial vines where bud dormancy and out-growth affect flower development. To determine the role of SVP-like genes in dormancy and flowering of kiwifruit, four MADS-box genes with homology to Arabidopsis SVP, designated SVP1, SVP2, SVP3, and SVP4, have been identified and analysed in kiwifruit and functionally characterized in Arabidopsis. Phylogenetic analysis indicate that these genes fall into different sub-clades within the SVP-like gene group, suggesting distinct functions. Expression was generally confined to vegetative tissues, and increased transcript accumulation in shoot buds over the winter period suggests a role for these genes in bud dormancy. Down-regulation before flower differentiation indicate possible roles as floral repressors. Over-expression and complementation studies in Arabidopsis resulted in a range of floral reversion phenotypes arising from interactions with Arabidopsis MADS-box proteins, but only SVP1 and SVP3 were able to complement the svp mutant. These results suggest that the kiwifruit SVP-like genes may have distinct roles during bud dormancy and flowering.

AB  - In flowering plants, male gametes (sperm cells) develop within male gametophytes (pollen grains) and are delivered to female gametes for double fertilization by pollen tubes. Therefore, pollen tube growth is crucial for reproduction. The mechanisms that control pollen tube growth remain poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrated that the ARID-HMG DNA-binding protein AtHMGB15 plays an important role in pollen tube growth. This protein is preferentially expressed in pollen grains and pollen tubes and is localized in the vegetative nuclei of the tricellular pollen grains and pollen tubes. Knocking down AtHMGB15 expression via a Ds insertion caused retarded pollen tube growth, leading to a significant reduction in the seed set. The athmgb15-1 mutation affected the expression of 1686 genes in mature pollen, including those involved in cell wall formation and modification, cell signaling and cellular transport during pollen tube growth. In addition, it was observed that AtHMGB15 binds to DNA in vitro and interacts with the transcription factors AGL66 and AGL104, which are required for pollen maturation and pollen tube growth. These results suggest that AtHMGB15 functions in pollen tube growth through the regulation of gene expression.

AB  - Malformed tomato fruit with multiple locules is a common physiological disorder that significantly affects the quality of tomatoes. Research has shown that the occurrence of malformed fruit in tomatoes is closely linked to the number of locules, and two key QTLs, lc and fas, are involved in controlling this trait. It has been observed that lc has a relatively weaker effect on increasing locule number, which is associated with two SNPs in the CArG repressor element downstream of the SlWUS. However, the precise molecular mechanism underlying lc is not yet fully understood. In this study, we investigated the role of lc in tomato locule development. We found that the number of floral organs and fruit locules significantly increased in tomato lc knockout mutants. Additionally, these mutants showed higher expression levels of the SlWUS during carpel formation. Through cDNA library construction and yeast one-hybrid screening, we identified the MADS-box transcription factor SlSEP3, which was found to bind to lc. Furthermore, we observed an increase in floral organs and fruit locules similar to the lc (CR) plant on SlSEP3 silencing plants. However, it should be noted that the lc site is located after the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of SlWUS in the tomato genome. As a result, SlSEP3 may not be able to exert regulatory functions on the promoter of the gene like other transcription factors. In the yeast two-hybrid assay, we found that several histone deacetylases (SlHDA1, SlHDA3, SlHDA4, SlHDA5, SlHDA6, SlHDA7, and SlHDA8) can interact with SlSEP3. This indicated that SlSEP3 can recruit these proteins to repress nucleosome relaxation, thereby inhibiting SlWUS transcription and affecting the number of locules in tomato fruit. Therefore, our findings reveal a new mechanism for lc playing a significant role in the genetic pathway regulating tomato locule development.

AB  - The E class MADS-box genes SEPALLATA (SEP)-like play critical roles in angiosperm reproductive growth, especially in floral organ differentiation. To analyze the sequence characteristics and spatio-temporal expression patterns of E-function MADS-box SEP-like genes during kale (Brassica oleracea L. var. acephala) flower development, BroaSEP1/2/3 (GenBank No. KC967957, KC967958, KC967960) homologues, three kale SEP MADS-box gene, were isolated from the kale variety 'Fourteen Line' using Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). Sequence and phylogenetic analysis indicated that these three SEP genes had a high degree of identity with SEP1, SEP2, SEP3 from Brassica oleracea var. oleracea, Brassica rapa, Raphanus sativus and Brassica napus, respectively. Alignment of the predicted amino acid sequences from these genes, along with previously published subfamily members, demonstrated that these genes comprise four regions of the typical MIKC-type MADS-box proteins: the MADS domain, intervening (I) domain and keratin-like (K) domain, and the C-terminal domain SEPⅠ and SEP Ⅱ motif. The longest open reading frame deduced from the cDNA sequences of BroaSEP1, BroaSEP2, and BroaSEP3 appeared to be 801 bp, 759 bp, 753 bp in length, respectively, which encoded proteins of 266, 252, and 250 amino acids respectively. Expression analyses using semi-quantitative RT-PCR and quantitative real-time PCR indicate that BroaSEP1/2/3 are specifically expressed in floral buds of kale during flower development process. The expression levels of the three genes are very different at different developmental stages, also in wild type, mutant flower with increased petals, and mutant flower with decreased petals. These different patterns of gene expression maybe cause the flowers to increase or decrease the petal number.

AB  - Triticum petropavlovskyi, commonly known as Xinjiang rice wheat, is a unique hexaploidy wheat grown in the Xinjiang area. T. petropavlovskyi is marked by its elongated glume (Eg) trait, which is controlled by gene P1pet located on chromosome 7A (Wang et al., 2002; Watanabe and Imamura, 2002). The origin of T. petropavlovskyi has been disputed. It is generally accepted that P1pet was introduced from tetraploid polish wheat (T. polonicum) via a hybridization with hexaploid common wheat (T. aestivum) (Akond et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2016). The P1pet has pleiotropic effects in the increase of spike length, grain length, and grain weight, and decrease of fertility, grain number, and awn length (Okamoto et al., 2013), indicating the potential impact of P1pet on grain yield-related traits. The cloning of P1pet will provide evidence for the prognosis of whether a mutation at P1 in T. petropavlovskyi or T. polonicum gave rise to the Eg trait and facilitate the utilization of this unique species in breeding for yield improvement.
In this study, the locus P1pet was fine mapped via a stepwise mapping approach. By linkage analysis using a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population between T. petropavlovskyi AKSu (AKS) and Chinese Spring (CS) (supplemental Figure 1), the P1pet was mapped into a marker interval between Xwmc826 and Xgpw2119 (supplemental Figure 2A, supplemental Table 1), corresponding to the 101.30–130.24 Mb physical region of 7AS. Further mapping using a chromosome segment substitution line (CSSL) population between T. petropavlovskyi Luopu (LP) and Yangmai158 (YM) allocated P1pet into the 127.91–133.22 Mb region of 7AS, flanked by two SNP markers AX-109335244 and AX-108807463 (supplemental Figure 1 and 2B). The two mapping results shared the 127.91–130.24 Mb overlapping region, in which the P1pet could be allocated. To fine map P1pet, a secondary F2 population derived from a cross between YM and a CSSL line LZP87 (morphologically resembling YM except for the Eg trait from LP, supplemental Figure 2C and 2D). Two P1pet flanking markers, SSR0 and CAPS36261, encompassing the P1pet region, were used to genotype the population for recombinant screening. By phenotyping of 22 recombinants, we fine-mapped P1pet into a marker interval SNP41698 and SSR4, corresponding to a 128.8–129.6 Mb genomic region. Twelve genes (G1–G12) were annotated in this region according to RefSeqv1.1 annotation of CS references (Figure 1A).

AB  - Histone acetylation is an important posttranslational modification associated with gene activation. In Arabidopsis, two MYST histone acetyltransferases HAM1 and HAM2 work redundantly to acetylate histone H4 lysine 5 (H4K5ace) in vitro. The double mutant ham1/ham2 is lethal, which suggests the critical role of HAM1 and HAM2 in development. Here, we used an artificial microRNA (amiRNA) strategy in Arabidopsis to uncover a novel function of HAM1 and HAM2. The amiRNA-HAM1/2 transgenic plants showed early flowering and reduced fertility. In addition, they responded normally to photoperiod, gibberellic acid treatment, and vernalization. The expression of flowering-repressor FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) and its homologues, MADS-box Affecting Flowering genes 3/4 (MAF3/4), were decreased in amiRNA-HAM1/2 lines. HAM1 overexpression caused late flowering and elevated expression of FLC and MAF3/4. Mutation of FLC almost rescued the late flowering with HAM1 overexpression, which suggests that HAM1 regulation of flowering time depended on FLC. Global H4 acetylation was decreased in amiRNA-HAM1/2 lines, but increased in HAM1-OE lines, which further confirmed the acetyltransferase activity of HAM1 in vivo. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that H4 hyperacetylation and H4K5ace at FLC and MAF3/4 were less abundant in amiRNA-HAM1/2 lines than the wild type, but were enriched in HAM1-OE lines. Thus, HAM1 and HAM2 may affect flowering time by epigenetic modification of FLC and MAF3/4 chromatins at H4K5 acetylation.

AB  - MADS-domain proteins are important transcription factors involved in many biological processes of plants. In our study, a tomato MADS-box gene, SlFYFL, was isolated. SlFYFL is expressed in all tissues of tomato and significantly higher in mature leave, fruit of different stages, AZ (abscission zone) and sepal. Delayed leaf senescence and fruit ripening, increased storability and longer sepals were observed in 35S:FYFL tomato. The accumulation of carotenoid was reduced, and ethylene content, ethylene biosynthetic and responsive genes were down-regulated in 35S:FYFL fruits. Abscission zone (AZ) did not form normally and abscission zone development related genes were declined in AZs of 35S:FYFL plants. Yeast two-hybrid assay revealed that SlFYFL protein could interact with SlMADS-RIN, SlMADS1 and SlJOINTLESS, respectively. These results suggest that overexpression of SlFYFL regulate fruit ripening and development of AZ via interactions with the ripening and abscission zone-related MADS box proteins.

AB  - In woody plants, phase transitions substantially affect growth and development. Although there has been considerable interest in the regulatory mechanisms underlying phase changes, the associated epigenetic modifications remain relatively uncharacterized. We examined the DNA methylation changes and the transcriptional responses in adult and juvenile Malus hupehensis leaves. The DNA methylations were 66.61% and 68.3% in the CG context, 49.12% and 52.44% in the CHG context, and 7.02% and 8.22% in the CHH context for the adult and juvenile leaves, respectively. The number of differentially methylated regions in all contexts distributed in the genic regions varied. Additionally, inhibited DNA methylation in adult leaves activated the transcription of indole-3-acetic acid related genes in the signaling, response, and transport pathways. Moreover, the opposite methylation and expression patterns were observed for the SPL and AP2 family genes between the adult and juvenile leaves. Both gene families contribute to the M. hupehensis vegetative phase transition. Furthermore, the hyper-/hypomethylation of the gene body or promoter of transcription factor genes may lead to up-/downregulated gene expression. The methylation levels of the WRKY (22), NAC (21), ERF (8), WOX (2), KNAT (6), EIN3 (2), SCL (7), ZAT (7), and HSF (4) genes were higher in the adult leaves than in the juvenile leaves, whereas the opposite pattern was observed for the TCP (2), MADS-box (11), and DOF (3) genes. An analysis of the correlation between methylation and transcription indicated the methylation of the gene body in all contexts and the methylation of the promoter in the CG and CHG contexts are negatively correlated with gene expression. However, the methylation of the promoter in the CHH context is positively correlated with gene expression. These findings reflect the diversity in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression and may be useful for elucidating the epigenetic regulatory mechanism underlying the M. hupehensis vegetative phase transition.

AB  - In flowering plants, sepals play important roles in the development of flowers and fruit, and both processes are regulated by MADS-box (MADS) transcription factors (TFs). SlMADS1 was previously reported to act as a negative regulator of fruit ripening. In this study, expression analysis shown that its transcripts were very highly expressed during the development of sepals. To test the role of SlMADS1, we generated KO-SlMADS1 (knock-out) tomato mutants by CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and CRISPR-associated protein 9) technology and over-expression of SlMADS1 (OE-SlMADS1). The sepals and individual cells of KO-SlMADS1 mutants were significantly elongated, compared with the wild type (WT), whereas the sepals of OE-SlMADS1 tomatoes were significantly shorter and their cells were wider. RNA-seq (RNA-sequencing) of sepal samples showed that ethylene-, gibberellin-, auxin-, cytokinin- and cell wall metabolism-related genes were significantly affected in both KO-SlMADS1 and OE-SlMADS1 plants with altered sepal size. Since SlMACROCALYX (MC) is known to regulate the development of tomato sepals, we also studied the relationship between SlMC and SlMADS1 and the result showed that SlMADS1 interacts directly with SlMC. In addition, we also found that manipulating SlMADS1 expression alters the development of tomato plant leaves, roots and plant height. These results enrich our understanding of sepal development and the function of SlMADS1 throughout the plant.

AB  - The Asteraceae is the largest angiosperm family with more than 25,000 species. Individual studies have shown that MADS-box and TCP transcription factors are regulators of the development and symmetry of flowers, contributing to their iconic flower-head (capitulum) and floret. However, a systematic study of MADS-box and TCP genes across the Asteraceae is lacking. We performed a comparative analysis of genome sequences of 33 angiosperm species including our de novo assembly of diploid sexual dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) and 11 other Asteraceae to investigate the lineage-specific evolution of MADS-box and TCP genes in the Asteraceae. We compared the phylogenomic results of MADS-box and TCP genes with their expression in T. officinale floral tissues at different developmental stages to demonstrate the regulation of genes with Asteraceae-specific attributes. Here, we show that MADS-box MIKC (c) and TCP-CYCLOIDEA (CYC) genes have expanded in the Asteraceae. The phylogenomic analysis identified AGAMOUS-like (AG-like: SEEDSTICK [STK]-like), SEPALATA-like (SEP3-like), and TCP-PROLIFERATING CELL FACTOR (PCF)-like copies with lineage-specific genomic contexts in the Asteraceae, Cichorioideae, or dandelion. Different expression patterns of some of these gene copies suggest functional divergence. We also confirm the presence and revisit the evolutionary history of previously named "Asteraceae-Specific MADS-box genes (AS-MADS)." Specifically, we identify non-Asteraceae homologs, indicating a more ancient origin of this gene clade. Syntenic relationships support that AS-MADS is paralogous to FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) as demonstrated by the shared ancient duplication of FLC and SEP3.

AB  - High night temperature (HNT) causes substantial yield loss in rice (Oryza sativa L.). In this study, the physiological processes related to flag leaf dark respiration (Rn) and grain filling under HNT were explored in a multi-parent advanced generation intercross population developed for heat tolerance (MAGIC(heat) ) along with selected high temperature tolerant breeding lines developed with heat-tolerant parents. Within a subset of lines, flag leaf Rn under HNT treatment was related to lower spikelet number per panicle and thus reduced yield. HNT enhanced the nighttime reduction of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) in stem tissue, but not in leaves, and stem nighttime NSC reduction was negatively correlated with yield. Between heading and harvest, the major difference in NSC concentration was found for starch, but not for soluble sugar. HNT weakened the relationship between NSC remobilization and harvest index at both the phenotypic and genetic level. By using genome-wide association studies, an invertase inhibitor, MADS box transcription factors and a UDP-glycosyltransferase that were identified as candidate genes orchestrating stem NSC remobilization in the control treatment were lost under HNT. With the identification of physiological and genetic components related to rice HNT response, this study offers promising prebreeding materials and trait targets to sustain yield stability under climate change.

AB  - Histone lysines can be mono-, di-, or trimethylated, providing an ample magnitude of epigenetic information for transcription regulation. In fungi, SET2 is the sole methyltransferase responsible for mono-, di-, and trimethylation of H3K36. Here we show that in Arabidopsis thaliana, the degree of H3K36 methylation is regulated by distinct methyltransferases. The SET2 homologs SDG8 and SDG26 each can methylate oligonucleosomes in vitro, and both proteins are localized in the nucleus. While the previously reported loss-of-function sdg8 mutants have an early-flowering phenotype, the loss-of-function sdg26 mutants show a late-flowering phenotype. Consistently, several MADS-box flowering repressors are down-regulated by sdg8 but up-regulated by sdg26. The sdg8 but not the sdg26 mutant plants show a dramatically reduced level of both di- and trimethyl-H3K36 and an increased level of monomethyl-H3K36. SDG8 is thus specifically required for di- and trimethylation of H3K36. Our results further establish that H3K36 di- and tri- but not monomethylation correlates with transcription activation. Finally, we show that SDG8 and VIP4, which encodes a component of the PAF1 complex, act independently and synergistically in transcription regulation. Together our results reveal that the deposition of H3K36 methylation is finely regulated, possibly to cope with the complex regulation of growth and development in higher eukaryotes.

AB  - Populus euphratica Oliv., a dominant species of arid desert community, grows heteromorphic leaves at different crown positions. Whether heteromorphic leaves are a strategy of plant adaptation to drought stress is rarely reported. This study sequenced the transcriptome of three typical heteromorphic leaves (lanceolate, ovate and broad-ovate leaves) of P. euphratica, and measured their drought stress. We wanted to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of heteromorphic leaves. Drought stress was increased significantly from lanceolate to ovate to broad-ovate leaves. Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG enrichment analysis showed that the MADs-box gene regulated the expression of peroxidase (POD) in the phenylpropane biosynthetic pathway. The up-regulated expression of the chalcone synthase (CHS) gene in broad-ovate leaves significantly activated the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway. In the process of leaf shape change, the different expressions of homeodomain leucine zipper (HD-ZIP) among the three heteromorphic leaves had potential interactions on the AUX and ABA pathways. The expression of Sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) and sucrose synthase (SUS) increased from lanceolate to broad-ovate leaves, resulting in a consistent change in starch and sucrose content. We concluded that these resistance-related pathways are expressed in parallel with leaf formation genes, thereby inducing the formation of heteromorphic leaves. Our work provided a new insights for desert plants to adapt to drought stress.

AB  - As one of the most economically significant Oleaceae family members, Jasminum sambac is renowned for its distinct sweet, heady fragrance. Using Illumina reads, Nanopore long reads, and HiC-sequencing, we efficiently assembled and annotated the J. sambac genome. The high-quality genome assembly consisted of a total of 507 Mb sequence (contig N50 = 17.6 Mb) with 13 pseudomolecules. A total of 21,143 protein-coding genes and 303 Mb repeat sequences were predicted. An ancient whole-genome triplication event at the base of Oleaceae (~66 million years ago [Ma], Late Cretaceous) was identified and this may have contributed to the diversification of the Oleaceae ancestor and its divergence from the Lamiales. Stress-related (e.g., WRKY) and flowering-related (e.g., MADS-box) genes were located in the triplicated regions, suggesting that the polyploidy event might have contributed adaptive potential. Genes related to terpenoid biosynthesis, for example, FTA and TPS, were observed to be duplicated to a great extent in the J. sambac genome, perhaps explaining the strong fragrance of the flowers. Copy number changes in distinct phylogenetic clades of the MADS-box family were observed in J. sambac genome, for example, AGL6- and Malpha- were lost and SOC- expanded, features that might underlie the long flowering period of J. sambac. The structural genes implicated in anthocyanin biosynthesis were depleted and this may explain the absence of vivid colours in jasmine. Collectively, assembling the J. sambac genome provides new insights into the genome evolution of the Oleaceae family and provides mechanistic insights into floral properties.

AB  - Winter dormancy is a protective survival strategy for plants to resist harsh natural environments. In the context of global warming, the progression of dormancy has been significantly affected in perennials, which requires further research. Here, a systematic study was performed to compare the induction of dormancy in two closely related iris species with an ecodormancy-only process, the evergreen Iris japonica Thunb. and the deciduous Iris tectorum Maxim. under artificial conditions. Firstly, morphological and physiological observations were evaluated to ensure the developmental status of the two iris species. Furthermore, the expression patterns of the genes involved in key pathways related to plant winter dormancy were determined, and correlation analyses with dormancy marker genes were conducted. We found that deciduous iris entered dormancy earlier than evergreen iris under artificial dormancy induction conditions. Phytohormones and carbohydrates play roles in coordinating growth and stress responses during dormancy induction in both iris species. Moreover, dormancy-related MADS-box genes and SnRKs (Snf1-related protein kinase) might represent a bridge between carbohydrate and phytohormone interaction during iris dormancy. These findings provide a hypothetical model explaining the later dormancy in evergreen iris compared with deciduous iris under artificial dormancy induction conditions and reveal some candidate genes. The findings of this study could provide new insights into the research of dormancy in perennial plants with an ecodormancy-only process and contribute to effectively managing iris production, postharvest storage, and shipping.

AB  - Flavonoids are secondary metabolites that fulfil a multitude of functions during the plant life cycle. In Arabidopsis proanthocyanidins (PAs) are flavonoids that specifically accumulate in the innermost integuments of the seed testa (i.e. endothelium), as well as in the chalaza and micropyle areas, and play a vital role in protecting the embryo against various biotic and abiotic stresses. PAs accumulation in the endothelium requires the activity of the MADS box transcription factor TRANSPARENT TESTA (TT) 16 (ARABIDOPSIS B-SISTER/AGAMOUS-LIKE 32) and the UDP-glycosyltransferase TT15 (UGT80B1). Interestingly tt16 and tt15 mutants display a very similar flavonoid profiles and patterns of PA accumulation. By using a combination of genetic, molecular, biochemical, and histochemical methods, we showed that both TT16 and TT15 act upstream the PA biosynthetic pathway, but through two distinct genetic routes. We also demonstrated that the activity of TT16 in regulating cell fate determination and PA accumulation in the endothelium is required in the chalaza prior to the globular stage of embryo development. Finally this study provides new insight showing that TT16 and TT15 functions extend beyond PA biosynthesis in the inner integuments of the Arabidopsis seed coat.

AB  - In angiosperms, seed architecture is shaped by the coordinated development of three genetically different components: embryo, endosperm, and maternal tissues. The relative contribution of these tissues to seed mass and nutrient storage varies considerably among species. The development of embryo, endosperm, or nucellus maternal tissue as primary storage compartments defines three main typologies of seed architecture. It is still debated whether the ancestral angiosperm seed accumulated nutrients in the endosperm or the nucellus. During evolution, plants shifted repeatedly between these two storage strategies through molecular mechanisms that are largely unknown. Here, we characterize the regulatory pathway underlying nucellus and endosperm tissue partitioning in Arabidopsis thaliana We show that Polycomb-group proteins repress nucellus degeneration before fertilization. A signal initiated in the endosperm by the AGAMOUS-LIKE62 MADS box transcription factor relieves this Polycomb-mediated repression and therefore allows nucellus degeneration. Further downstream in the pathway, the TRANSPARENT TESTA16 (TT16) and GORDITA MADS box transcription factors promote nucellus degeneration. Moreover, we demonstrate that TT16 mediates the crosstalk between nucellus and seed coat maternal tissues. Finally, we characterize the nucellus cell death program and its feedback role in timing endosperm development. Altogether, our data reveal the antagonistic development of nucellus and endosperm, in coordination with seed coat differentiation.

AB  - The C-class MADS box gene AGAMOUS (AG) plays crucial roles in Arabidopsis thaliana development by regulating the organ identity of stamens and carpels, the repression of A-class genes, and floral meristem determinacy. To examine the conservation and diversification of C-class gene function in monocots, we analyzed two C-class genes in rice (Oryza sativa), OSMADS3 and OSMADS58, which may have arisen by gene duplication before divergence of rice and maize (Zea mays). A knockout line of OSMADS3, in which the gene is disrupted by T-DNA insertion, shows homeotic transformation of stamens into lodicules and ectopic development of lodicules in the second whorl near the palea where lodicules do not form in the wild type but carpels develop almost normally. By contrast, RNA-silenced lines of OSMADS58 develop astonishing flowers that reiterate a set of floral organs, including lodicules, stamens, and carpel-like organs, suggesting that determinacy of the floral meristem is severely affected. These results suggest that the two C-class genes have been partially subfunctionalized during rice evolution (i.e., the functions regulated by AG have been partially partitioned into two paralogous genes, OSMADS3 and OSMADS58, which were produced by a recent gene duplication event in plant evolution).

AB  - To understand the molecular basis of the endodormancy of buds of perennial plants, we searched for the genes that are expressed preferentially in endodormant lateral buds of the deciduous fruit tree japanese apricot (Prunus mume Sieb. et Zucc.) using suppression subtractive hybridization with mirror orientation selection (SSH/MOS). We generated two SSH/MOS libraries containing gene pools that are expressed preferentially in endodormant buds in comparison with paradormant or ecodormant buds to search for the genes that are upregulated by endodormancy induction or down-regulated by endodormancy release, respectively. Differential screening and sequencing indicated that genes involved in gibberellin metabolism, stress resistance, cell wall modification, and signal transduction, such as transcription factors, are upregulated in endodormant buds. After a further expression survey and full-length cDNA cloning, we found that a gene similar to the SVP/AGL24-type MADS-box transcription factor showed endodormancy-associated expression. Seasonal expression analysis suggested that the SVP/AGL24 homolog in japanese apricot might be involved in endodormancy regulation of its lateral buds.

AB  - The present study investigated the expressional regulation of PpDAM5 and PpDAM6, two of the six peach (Prunus persica) dormancy-associated MADS-box genes, in relation to lateral bud endodormancy. PpDAM5 and PpDAM6 were originally identified as homologues of Arabidopsis SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE/AGAMOUS-LIKE 24 identified in the EVERGROWING locus of peach. Furthermore, PpDAM5 and PpDAM6 have recently been suggested to be involved in terminal bud dormancy. In this study, seasonal expression analyses using leaves, stems, and lateral buds of high-chill and low-chill peaches in field conditions indicated that both genes were up-regulated during the endodormancy period and down-regulated with endodormancy release. Controlled environment experiments showed that the expression of both PpDAM5 and PpDAM6 were up-regulated by ambient cool temperatures in autumn, while they were down-regulated by the prolonged period of cold temperatures in winter. A negative correlation between expression levels of PpDAM5 and PpDAM6 and bud burst percentage was found in the prolonged cold temperature treatment. Application of the dormancy-breaking reagent cyanamide to endo/ecodormant lateral buds induced early bud break and down-regulation of PpDAM5 and PpDAM6 expression at the same time. These results collectively suggest that PpDAM5 and PpDAM6 may function in the chilling requirement of peach lateral buds through growth-inhibiting functions for bud break.

AB  - The MADS-box transcription factors play diverse roles in plant development, but little is known about the role of MADS-box genes in Ginkgo biloba. Here a MADS-box transcription factor gene, designated as GbMADS9, was cloned and functionally characterized from G. biloba. The open reading frame of GbMADS9 comprised 684 bp encoding a polypeptide of 227 amino acids. Phylogenetic analysis showed that GbMADS9 belonged to the GGM13 clade of Bsister-class MADS-box proteins. Real-time PCR results revealed that GbMADS9 was preferentially expressed in strobili and ovules. In addition, its expression was up-regulated with the increase in the size of ginkgo pulp, indicating that GbMADS9 had a positive function in ginkgo ovule development. The expression of GbMADS9 in ginkgo was up-regulated in response to salinity, drought, and cold stress, as well as to phytohormones gibberellic acid and abscisic acid. GbMADS9 transgenic Arabidopsis plants presented early flowering phenotypes compared with wild-type plants. The expression of the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), APETALA1 (AP1), LEAFY (LFY), and SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CO 1 (SOC1) genes involved in flowering was up-regulated, whereas the expression of AGAMOUS-LIKE24 (AGL24) and SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) was down-regulated in the GbMADS9 transgenic lines. The GbMADS9 transgenic plants exhibited better growth than wild-type plants under high osmotic stress. Enhanced tolerance of transgenic Arabidopsis plants to osmotic stress was confirmed by changes in the chlorophyll, proline, and malondialdehyde contents. Moreover, increased tolerance to osmotic stress in GbMADS9 transgenic lines was associated with improved antioxidant enzymatic activities. These findings suggested that GbMADS9 might be a promising gene to manipulate flowering time and improve abiotic stress tolerance in G. biloba.

AB  - The Orchidaceae is of economic and ecological importance and constitutes 10% of all seed plant species. Here, we report a genome physical map for Cymbidium sinense, a well-known species belonging to genus Cymbidium that has thousands of natural variation varieties of flower organs, flower and leaf colours and also referred as the King of Fragrance, which make it arose into a unique cultural symbol in China. The high-quality chromosome-scale genome assembly was 3.52 Gb in size, 29 638 protein-coding genes were predicted, and evidence for whole-genome duplication shared with other orchids was provided. Marked amplification of cytochrome- and photosystem-related genes was observed, which was consistent with the shade tolerance and dark green leaves of C. sinense. Extensive duplication of MADS-box genes, and the resulting subfunctional and expressional differentiation, was associated with regulation of species-specific flower traits, including wild-type and mutant-type floral patterning, seasonal flowering and ecological adaption. CsSEP4 was originally found to positively regulate gynostemium development. The CsSVP genes and their interaction proteins CsAP1 and CsSOC1 were significantly expanded and involved in the regulation of low-temperature-dependent flowering. Important genetic clues to the colourful leaf traits, purple-black flowers and volatile trait in C. sinense were also found. The results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of important phenotypic traits of Cymbidium and its evolution and serve as a powerful platform for future evolutionary studies and molecular breeding of orchids.

AB  - The MADS-box gene family is widely distributed in higher plants and the members of the angiosperm-specific APETALA1/FRUITFULL (AP1/FUL) subfamily plays important roles in the regulation of plant reproductive development. Recent studies revealed that the AP1/FUL subfamily member Dt2, VEGETATIVE1/PsFRUITFULc (VEG1/PsFULc) and MtFRUITFULc (MtFULc) are essential for the stem growth, branching and inflorescence development in legume species soybean (Glycine max), pea (Pisum sativum) and Medicago truncatula. However, the biological function of their homologue in Arabidopsis thaliana, AGAMOUS-LIKE 79 (AGL79), has not been well elucidated. In this study, we investigated the developmental roles of Arabidopsis AGL79 by CRISPR/Cas9-mutagenesis and molecular and physiological analyses. We found that AGL79 mainly acts as a transcriptional repressor and positively regulates Arabidopsis flowering time. We further revealed that AGL79 interacts with SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CO1 (SOC1) and represses the expression of TERMINAL FLOWER 1 (TFL1). Our results demonstrated the AGL79-mediated flowering regulation in Arabidopsis and added an additional layer of complexity to the understanding of flowering time regulation in dicot plants.

AB  - Inflorescence architecture in cereal crops directly impacts yield potential through regulation of seed number and harvesting ability. Extensive architectural diversity found in inflorescences of grass species is due to spatial and temporal activity and determinacy of meristems, which control the number and arrangement of branches and flowers, and underlie plasticity. Timing of the floral transition is also intimately associated with inflorescence development and architecture, yet little is known about the intersecting pathways and how they are rewired during development. Here, we show that a single mutation in a gene encoding an AP1/FUL-like MADS-box transcription factor significantly delays flowering time and disrupts multiple levels of meristem determinacy in panicles of the C4 model panicoid grass, Setaria viridis. Previous reports of AP1/FUL-like genes in cereals have revealed extensive functional redundancy, and in panicoid grasses, no associated inflorescence phenotypes have been described. In S. viridis, perturbation of SvFul2, both through chemical mutagenesis and gene editing, converted a normally determinate inflorescence habit to an indeterminate one, and also repressed determinacy in axillary branch and floral meristems. Our analysis of gene networks connected to disruption of SvFul2 identified regulatory hubs at the intersection of floral transition and inflorescence determinacy, providing insights into the optimization of cereal crop architecture.

AB  - In Arabidopsis thaliana L., stomata are produced through a series of divisions including asymmetric and symmetric divisions. Asymmetric entry division of meristemoid mother cell produces two daughter cells, the smaller meristemoid and the larger sister cell, a stomatal lineage ground cell (SLGC). Stomatal lineage ground cells can differentiate into epidermal pavement cells but have the potential to divide asymmetrically, spacing divisions, to create satellite meristemoids. Peptide ligands and TOO MANY MOUTHS (TMM) and ERECTA family receptors regulate the initiation of stomatal lineages, activity, and orientation of spacing divisions. Here, we reported that a natural mutant 28y displayed an increased stomatal density and index. Using map-based cloning, we identified mutation in ARGONAUTE1 (AGO1) as the cause of 28y phenotypes. Time-lapse tracing of stomatal lineage cells reveals that stomatal overproduction in 28y is caused by the excessive asymmetric spacing division of SLGCs. Further genetic results demonstrated that AGO1 acts downstream of TMM and negatively regulates the SPCH transcripts, but in a brassinosteroid-independent manner. Upregulation of AGAMOUS-LIKE16 (AGL16) in 28y mutants suggests that AGO1 is required to restrict AGL16-mediated stomatal spacing divisions, an miRNA pathway in addition to ligand-receptor signaling modules.

AB  - As the most significant transformation stage of plants, the flowering process has typically been the focus of research. MADS-box gene plays an important regulatory role in flower development. In this study, 26 MADS-box genes were identified from Ginkgo biloba, including 10 type-I genes and 16 type-II genes, which were distributed on eight chromosomes. There was no collinearity between the GbMADS genes, and the homology with genes from other species was low. All GbMADS proteins contain conserved MADS domains. The gene structures of GbMADS in the same gene family or subfamily differed, but the conserved protein motifs had similar distributions. The microRNA (miRNA) target sites of the GbMADS genes were predicted. It was found that the expression of 16 GbMADS genes may be regulated by miRNA. The results of cis-acting element analysis showed that the 26 GbMADS genes contained a large number of hormones regulated and light-responsive elements as well as stress-response elements. Furthermore, the quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) experimental results showed that most GbMADS genes were differentially expressed in the male and female flowers at different developmental stages. Among them, the only MIKC * gene GbMADS16 has the highest expression in the metaphase development of the microstrobilus (M2) stage and is almost not expressed in female flowers. Taken together, these findings suggest that the MADS-box genes may play an important role in the development and differentiation of G. biloba flowers.

AB  - The AGL6 (AGMOUSE LIKE 6) gene is a member of the SEP subfamily and functions as an E-class floral homeotic gene in the development of floral organs. In this study, we cloned IiAGL6, the orthologous gene of AGL6 in Isatis indigotica. The constitutive expression of IiAGL6 in Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in a late-flowering phenotype and the development of curly leaves during the vegetative growth period. Abnormal changes in floral organ development were observed during the reproductive stage. In woad plants, suppression of IiAGL6 using TRV-VIGS (tobacco rattle virus-mediated virus-induced gene silencing) decreased the number of stamens and led to the formation of aberrant anthers. Similar changes in stamen development were also observed in miRNA-AGL6 transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Yeast two-hybrid and BiFC tests showed that IiAGL6 can interact with other MADS-box proteins in woad; thus, playing a key role in defining the identities of floral organs, particularly during stamen formation. These findings might provide novel insights and help investigate the biological roles of MADS transcription factors in I. indigotica.

AB  - Bud dormancy is indispensable for the survival of perennial plants in cold winters. Abscisic acid (ABA) has essential functions influencing the endo-dormancy status. Dormancy-associated MADS-box/SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE-like genes function downstream of the ABA signalling pathway to regulate bud dormancy. However, the regulation of DAM/SVP expression remains largely uncharacterized. In this study, we confirmed that endo-dormancy maintenance and PpyDAM3 expression are controlled by the ABA content in pear (Pyrus pyrifolia) buds. The expression of pear ABRE-BINDING FACTOR3 (PpyABF3) was positively correlated with PpyDAM3 expression. Furthermore, PpyABF3 directly bound to the second ABRE in the PpyDAM3 promoter to activate its expression. Interestingly, both PpyABF3 and PpyDAM3 repressed the cell division and growth of transgenic pear calli. Another ABA-induced ABF protein, PpyABF2, physically interacted with PpyABF3 and disrupted the activation of the PpyDAM3 promoter by PpyABF3, indicating DAM expression was precisely controlled. Additionally, our results suggested that the differences in the PpyDAM3 promoter in two pear cultivars might be responsible for the diversity in the chilling requirements. In summary, our data clarify the finely tuned regulatory mechanism underlying the effect of ABA on DAM gene expression and provide new insights into ABA-related bud dormancy regulation.

AB  - Three of the nitrilases (NITs), NIT1, NIT2, and NIT3, are ubiquitously existing in plant kingdom, which catalyze indole-3-acetonitrile into the most important auxin indole-3-acetic acid. Auxin is an indispensable hormone, which plays the important roles in almost all processes of plant growth and development. However, there are few reports on the regulation of flowering-time mediated by auxin. Here, we found that in Arabidopsis, nit1/2/3 showed a late flowering phenotype in short days. To explore the molecular mechanism by which NIT1/2/3 regulate flowering time, we performed transcriptome sequencing of nit1/2/3. The results showed that the expression of a MADS-box transcription factor gene MADS AFFECTING FLOWERING4 (MAF4) was dramatically increased in nit1/2/3 comparing to wild type (WT). MAF4 is one of the paralogs of the potent flowering inhibitor FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). There are four other paralogs in FLC clade in Arabidopsis, including FLOWERING LOCUS M (FLM/MAF1), MAF2, MAF3, and MAF5. The late flowering phenotype of nit1/2/3 could not be observed in the maf4 background, indicating that the phenotype was specifically dependent on MAF4 rather than other FLC clade members. Interestingly, the expression of a lncRNA gene MAS, which is transcribed in the opposite direction of MAF4, was found significantly increased in nit1/2/3. Also, MAS has been reported to activate MAF4 transcription by promoting histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3). As expected, H3K4me3 deposition at MAF4 locus in nit1/2/3 was highly enriched and significantly higher than that of WT. In summary, we show that NITs, NIT1/2/3, positively regulate flowering by repressing MAF4 through manipulating H3K4me3 modification. Further study needs to be performed to explore the largely unknown mechanisms behind it.

AB  - B(sister) genes have been identified as the closest relatives of class B floral homeotic genes. Previous studies have shown that B(sister) genes from eudicots are involved in cell differentiation during ovule and seed development. However, the complete function of B(sister) genes in eudicots is masked by redundancy with other genes and little is known about the function of B(sister) genes in monocots, and about the evolution of B(sister) gene functions. Here we characterize OsMADS29, one of three MADS-box B(sister) genes in rice. Our analyses show that OsMADS29 is expressed in female reproductive organs including the ovule, ovule vasculature, and the whole seed except for the outer layer cells of the pericarp. Knock-down of OsMADS29 by double-stranded RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) results in shriveled and/or aborted seeds. Histological analyses of the abnormal seeds at 7 days after pollination (DAP) indicate that the symplastic continuity, including the ovular vascular trace and the nucellar projection, which is the nutrient source for the filial tissue at early development stages, is affected. Moreover, degeneration of all the maternal tissues in the transgenic seeds, including the pericarp, ovular vascular trace, integuments, nucellar epidermis and nucellar projection, is blocked as compared to control plants. Our results suggest that OsMADS29 has important functions in seed development of rice by regulating cell degeneration of maternal tissues. Our findings provide important insights into the ancestral function of B(sister) genes.

AB  - Eukaryotic cold shock domain proteins are nucleic acid-binding proteins that are involved in transcription, translation via RNA chaperone activity, RNA editing, and DNA repair during tissue developmental processes and stress responses. Cold shock domain proteins have been functionally implicated in important developmental transitions, including embryogenesis, in both animals and plants. Arabidopsis thaliana cold shock domain protein 4 (AtCSP4) contains a well conserved cold shock domain (CSD) and glycine-rich motifs interspersed by two retroviral-like CCHC zinc fingers. AtCSP4 is expressed in all tissues but accumulates in reproductive tissues and those undergoing cell divisions. Overexpression of AtCSP4 reduces silique length and induces embryo lethality. Interestingly, a T-DNA insertion atcsp4 mutant does not exhibit any morphological abnormalities, suggesting that the related AtCSP2 gene is functionally redundant with AtCSP4. During silique development, AtCSP4 overexpression induced early browning and shrunken seed formation beginning with the late heart embryo stage. A 50% segregation ratio of the defective seed phenotype was consistent with the phenotype of endosperm development gene mutants. Transcripts of FUS3 and LEC1 genes, which regulate early embryo formation, were not altered in the AtCSP4 overexpression lines. On the other hand, MEA and FIS2 transcripts, which are involved in endosperm development, were affected by AtCSP4 overexpression. Additionally, AtCSP4 overexpression resulted in up-regulation of several MADS-box genes (AP1, CAL, AG, and SHP2) during early stages of silique development. Collectively, these data suggest that AtCSP4 plays an important role during the late stages of silique development by affecting the expression of several development-related genes.

AB  - To study the role of MADS-box genes in developing apples (Malus ×domestica Borkh.), clones corresponding to seven different genes, MdMADS5 to MdMADS11, were isolated from a 2-day-old apple cDNA library. Through DNA sequence comparison, six genes were classified into the APETALA1 (AP1) group and one gene, MdMADS10, into the AGAMOUS (AG) group. Six of the genes, MdMADS5 to MdMADS10, were found to be preferentially expressed in fruit following pollination. These genes also showed differential expression patterns in core, cortex and skin of young fruit. For instance, MdMADS5, which is highly homologous to AP1, showed preferential expression in the cortex and skin tissues while MdMADS10, which is highly homologous to AGL11, showed exclusive expression in the core tissues. The gene MdMADS11 showed a similar expression level and pattern in flowers, fruit at several early developmental stages, and for different fruit tissues. The range of expression patterns suggests that the genes play different roles in apple development.

AB  - Floral transition is regulated by environmental and endogenous signals. Previously, we identified VASCULAR PLANT ONE-ZINC FINGER1 (VOZ1) and VOZ2 as phytochrome B-interacting factors. VOZ1 and VOZ2 redundantly promote flowering and have pivotal roles in the downregulation of FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), a central repressor of flowering in Arabidopsis. Here, we showed that the late-flowering phenotypes of the voz1 voz2 mutant were suppressed by vernalization in the Columbia and FRIGIDA (FRI)-containing accessions, which indicates that the late-flowering phenotype of voz1 voz2 mutants was caused by upregulation of FLC. We also showed that the other FLC clade members, MADS AFFECTING FLOWERING (MAF) genes, were also a downstream target of VOZ1 and VOZ2 as their expression levels were also increased in the voz1 voz2 mutant. Our results suggest that the FLC clade genes integrate signals from VOZ1/VOZ2 and vernalization to regulate flowering.

AB  - MADS-box genes are involved in various developmental processes including vegetative development, flower architecture, flowering, pollen formation, seed and fruit development. However, the function of most MADS-box genes and their regulation mechanism are still unclear in woody plants compared with model plants. In this study, a MADS-box gene (CiMADS43) was identified in citrus. Phylogenetic and sequence analysis showed that CiMADS43 is a GOA-like Bsister MADS-box gene. It was localized in the nucleus and as a transcriptional activator. Overexpression of CiMADS43 promoted early flowering and leaves curling in transgenic Arabidopsis. Besides, overexpression or knockout of CiMADS43 also showed leaf curl phenotype in citrus similar to that of CiMADS43 overexpressed in Arabidopsis. Protein-protein interaction found that a SEPALLATA (SEP)-like protein (CiAGL9) interacted with CiMADS43 protein. Interestingly, CiAGL9 also can bind to the CiMADS43 promoter and promote its transcription. Expression analysis also showed that these two genes were closely related to seasonal flowering and the development of the leaf in citrus. Our findings revealed the multifunctional roles of CiMADS43 in the vegetative and reproductive development of citrus. These results will facilitate our understanding of the evolution and molecular mechanisms of MADS-box genes in citrus.

AB  - Leaf senescence is a developmental process induced by various molecular and environmental stimuli that may affect crop yield. The dark-induced leaf senescence-91 (DLS-91) plants displayed rapid leaf senescence, dramatically decreased chlorophyll contents, low photochemical efficiencies, and upregulation of the senescence-associated marker gene BrSAG12-1. To understand DLS molecular mechanism, we examined transcriptomic changes in DLS-91 and control line DLS-42 following 0, 1, and 4 days of dark treatment (DDT) stages. We identified 501, 446, and 456 DEGs, of which 16.7%, 17.2%, and 14.4% encoded TFs, in samples from the three stages. qRT-PCR validation of 16 genes, namely, 7 MADS, 6 NAC, and 3 WRKY, suggested that BrAGL8-1, BrAGL15-1, and BrWRKY70-1 contribute to the rapid leaf senescence of DLS-91 before (0 DDT) and after (1 and 4 DDT) dark treatment, whereas BrNAC046-2, BrNAC029-2/BrNAP, and BrNAC092-1/ORE1 TFs may regulate this process at a later stage (4 DDT). In-silico analysis of cis-acting regulatory elements of BrAGL8-1, BrAGL42-1, BrNAC029-2, BrNAC092-1, and BrWRKY70-3 of B. rapa provides insight into the regulation of these genes. Our study has uncovered several AGL-MADS, WRKY, and NAC TFs potentially worthy of further study to understand the underlying mechanism of rapid DLS in DLS-91.

AB  - MADS-box genes have been demonstrated to participate in a number of processes in tomato development, especially fruit ripening. In this study, we reported a novel MADS-box gene, SlMBP15, which is implicated in fruit ripening. Based on statistical analysis, the ripening time of SlMBP15-silenced tomato was delayed by 2-4 days compared with that of the wild-type (WT). The accumulation of carotenoids and biosynthesis of ethylene in fruits were decreased in SlMBP15-silenced tomato. Genes related to carotenoid and ethylene biosynthesis were greatly repressed. SlMBP15 can interact with RIN, a MADS-box regulator affecting the carotenoid accumulation and ethylene biosynthesis in tomato. In addition, SlMBP15-silenced tomato produced dark green leaves, and its plant height was reduced. The gibberellin (GA) content of transgenic plants was lower than that of the WT and GA biosynthesis genes were repressed. These results demonstrated that SlMBP15 not only positively regulated tomato fruit ripening but also affected the morphogenesis of the vegetative organs.

AB  - The APETALA1 (AP1)/FRUITFULL (FUL)-like transcription factor OsMADS18 plays diverse functions in rice development, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are far from fully understood. Here, we report that down-regulation of OsMADS18 expression in RNAi lines caused a delay in seed germination and young seedling growth, whereas the overexpression of OsMADS18 produced plants with fewer tillers. In targeted OsMADS18 genome-edited mutants (osmads18-cas9), an increased number of tillers, altered panicle size, and reduced seed setting were observed. The EYFP-OsMADS18 (full-length) protein was localized to the nucleus and plasma membrane but the EYFP-OsMADS18-N (N-terminus) protein mainly localized to the nucleus. The expression of OsMADS18 could be stimulated by abscisic acid (ABA), and ABA stimulation triggered the cleavage of HA-OsMADS18 and the translocation of OsMADS18 from the plasma membrane to the nucleus. The inhibitory effect of ABA on seedling growth was less effective in the OsMADS18-overexpressing plants. The expression of a set of ABA-responsive genes was significantly reduced in the overexpressing plants. The phenotypes of transgenic plants expressing EYFP-OsMADS18-N resembled those observed in the osmads18-cas9 mutants. Analysis of the interaction of OsMADS18 with OsMADS14, OsMADS15, and OsMADS57 strongly suggests an essential role for OsMADS18 in rice development.

AB  - The MADS-box family genes are involved in the development of plant roots, leaves, flowers, and fruits, and play a crucial role in plant growth and development. Studying MADS-box genes with K-box domain is crucial to distinguish different types of MADS-box genes. This study systematically analysed the genomic structural information of maize MADS-box family members containing the K-box Domain at the genome-wide level using the maize (Zea mays) B73 genome as the reference sequence, and provided insight into the biological functions of the maize MADS-box family containing the K-box domain. According to the findings, 52 MADS-box family genes with K-box domain were identified and divided into 4 subgroups. The distribution of motif in the same subgroup was found to be relatively conservative, and all of them had MADS-box conserved domain and K-box domain. Gene structure analysis showed that the introns and exons of the same subgroup genes have similar gene structure, and different types of genes containing the K-box domain showed different exon/intron structure characteristics. Chromosome mapping showed that 52 genes containing the K-box domain were unevenly distributed on the 10 chromosomes of maize, most of which were distributed at both ends of the chromosome and a small number of genes were distributed near the centromere. Based on the analysis of cis-acting elements of it up-stream promoter, it was found that MADS-box family genes may be involved in light response, IAA, GA, ABA, and LTR signal pathways, indicating that they play a certain role in stress response and hormone signal transduction. The expression analysis of genes with the K-box domain in maize leaves treated with auxin and gibberellin revealed that MADS-box genes may have a regulatory effect on certain plant hormones. Through the identification and bioinformatics analysis of MADS-box family genes containing the K-box domain, it is helpful to further study the function and pathway of MADS-box family genes, and provide a theoretical basis for further re-search for the molecular mechanism of maize growth and development.

AB  - MADS box genes are known to perform important functions in the development of various plant organs. Although the functions of many MADS box genes have previously been elucidated, the biological function of the type I MADS box genes remains poorly understood. In order to understand the function and regulation of the type I MADS box genes, we conducted molecular genetic analyses of AGL28, a member of the Malpha class of type I genes. AGL28 was expressed in vegetative tissues in a photoperiod-independent manner, but not within the reproductive apex. This indicates that AGL28 plays a role in the vegetative phase. Overexpression of AGL28 caused precocious flowering via the upregulation of the expression of FCA and LUMINIDEPENDENS (LD), both floral promoters within the autonomous pathway. However, the loss of AGL28 function did not result in any obvious flowering time phenotype, which suggests that AGL28 may perform a redundant function. Collectively, our data suggest that AGL28 is a positive regulator of known floral promoters within the autonomous pathway in Arabidopsis.

AB  - The pattern of molecular evolution of imprinted genes is controversial and the entire picture is still to be unveiled. Recently, a relationship between the formation of imprinted genes and gene duplication was reported in genome-wide survey of imprinted genes in Arabidopsis thaliana. Because gene duplications influence the molecular evolution of the duplicated gene family, it is necessary to investigate both the pattern of molecular evolution and the possible relationship between gene duplication and genomic imprinting for a better understanding of evolutionary aspects of imprinted genes. In this study, we investigated the evolutionary changes of type I MADS-box genes that include imprinted genes by using relative species of Arabidopsis thaliana (two subspecies of A. lyrata and three subspecies of A. halleri). A duplicated gene family enables us to compare DNA sequences between imprinted genes and its homologs. We found an increased number of gene duplications within species in clades containing the imprinted genes, further supporting the hypothesis that local gene duplication is one of the driving forces for the formation of imprinted genes. Moreover, data obtained by phylogenetic analysis suggested "rapid evolution" of not only imprinted genes but also its closely related orthologous genes, which implies the effect of gene duplication on molecular evolution of imprinted genes.

AB  - Arabidopsis PISTILLATA (PI) encodes B-class MADS-box transcription factor (TF), and works together with APETALA3 (AP3) to specify petal and stamen identity. However, a small-scale gene duplication event of PI ortholog was observed in common buckwheat and resulted in FaesPI_1 and FaesPI_2. FaesPI_1 and FaesPI_2 were expressed only in the stamen of dimorphic flower (thrum and pin) of Fagopyrum esculentum. Moreover, intense beta-glucuronidase (GUS) staining was found in the entire stamen (filament and anther) in pFaesPI_1::GUS transgenic Arabidopsis, while GUS was expressed only in the filament of pFaesPI_2::GUS transgenic Arabidopsis. In addition, phenotype complementation analysis suggested that pFaesPI_1::FaesPI_1/pFaesPI_2::FaesPI_2 transgenic pi-1 Arabidopsis showed similar a flower structure with stamen-like organs or filament-like organs in the third whorl. This suggested that FaesPI_2 only specified filament development, but FaesPI_1 specified stamen development. Meanwhile, FaesPI_1 and FaesPI_2 were shown to function redundantly in regulating filament development, and both genes work together to require a proper stamen identity. The data also provide a clue to understanding the roles of PI-like genes involved in floral organ development during the early evolution of core eudicots and also suggested that FaesPI_1 and FaesPI_2 hold the potential application in bioengineering to develop a common buckwheat male sterile line.

AB  - Iron walnut (Juglans sigillata Dode) is a native species in southwestern China that exhibits variation in both fruit morphology and shell thickness. However, the underlying molecular processes controlling hardened endocarp development in walnut has not yet been reported. Here, we generated transcriptional profiles of iron walnut endocarp at three developmental stages using "Dapao", the most common commercial variety. Using pairwise comparisons between these three stages, a total of 8555 non-redundant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, and more than one-half of the total DEGs exhibited significant differential expression in stage I as compared with stage II or stage III, suggesting that the first stage may ultimately determine the final characteristics of the mature walnut shell. Furthermore, in the clustering analysis of the above DEGs, 3682, 2349, and 2388 genes exhibited the highest expression in stages I, II, and III, respectively. GO enrichment analysis demonstrated that the major transcriptional variation among the three developmental stages was caused by differences in cell growth, plant hormones, metabolic process, and phenylpropanoid metabolism. Namely, using the tissue-specific expression analysis and a gene co-expression network, we identified MADS-box transcription factor JsiFBP2 and bHLH transcription factor JsibHLH94 as candidate regulators of endocarp formation in the early stage, and JsiNAC56 and JsiMYB78 might play key roles in regulating the lignification process of endocarp in the late stage. This study provides useful information for further research to dissect the molecular mechanisms governing the shell formation and development of iron walnut.

AB  - MADS-box transcription factors are vital regulators participating in plant growth and development process and the functions of most of them are still unknown. ANR1 was reported to play a key role in controlling lateral root development through nitrate signal in Arabidopsis. OsMADS25 is one of five ANR1-like genes in Oryza Sativa and belongs to the ANR1 clade. Here we have investigated the role of OsMADS25 in the plant's responses to external nitrate in Oryza Sativa. Our results showed that OsMADS25 protein was found in the nucleus as well as in the cytoplasm. Over-expression of OsMADS25 significantly promoted lateral and primary root growth as well as shoot growth in a nitrate-dependent manner in Arabidopsis. OsMADS25 overexpression in transgenic rice resulted in significantly increased primary root length, lateral root number, lateral root length and shoot fresh weight in the presence of nitrate. Down-regulation of OsMADS25 in transgenic rice exhibited significantly reduced shoot and root growth in the presence of nitrate. Furthermore, over-expression of OsMADS25 in transgenic rice promoted nitrate accumulation and significantly increased the expressions of nitrate transporter genes at high rates of nitrate supply while down-regulation of OsMADS25 produced the opposite effect. Taken together, our findings suggest that OsMADS25 is a positive regulator control lateral and primary root development in rice.

AB  - The ANR1 MADS-box gene in Arabidopsis is a key gene involved in regulating lateral root development in response to the external nitrate supply. There are five ANR1-like genes in Oryza sativa, OsMADS23, OsMADS25, OsMADS27, OsMADS57 and OsMADS61, all of which belong to the AGL17 clade. Here we have investigated the responsiveness of these genes to fluctuations in nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and sulfur (S) mineral nutrient supply. The MADS-box genes have been shown to have a range of responses to the nutrient supply. The expression of OsMADS61 was transiently induced by N deprivation but was not affected by re-supply with various N sources. The expression of OsMADS25 and OsMADS27 was induced by re-supplying with NO3(-) and NH4NO3, but downregulated by NH4(+). The expression of OsMADS57 was significantly downregulated by N starvation and upregulated by 3 h NO3(-) re-supply. OsMADS23 was the only gene that showed no response to either N starvation nor NO3(-) re-supply. OsMADS57 was the only gene not regulated by P fluctuation whereas the expression of OsMADS23, OsMADS25 and OsMADS27 was downregulated by P starvation and P re-supply. In contrast, all five ANR1-related genes were significantly upregulated by S starvation. Our results also indicated that there were interactions among nitrate, sulphate and phosphate transporters in rice.

AB  - Plant root system morphology is dramatically influenced by various environmental cues. The adaptation of root system architecture to environmental constraints, which mostly depends on the formation and growth of lateral roots, is an important agronomic trait. Lateral root development is regulated by the external signals coordinating closely with intrinsic signaling pathways. MADS-box transcription factors are known key regulators of the transition to flowering and flower development. However, their functions in root development are still poorly understood. Here we report that AGL21, an AGL17-clade MADS-box gene, plays a crucial role in lateral root development. AGL21 was highly expressed in root, particularly in the root central cylinder and lateral root primordia. AGL21 overexpression plants produced more and longer lateral roots while agl21 mutants showed impaired lateral root development, especially under nitrogen-deficient conditions. AGL21 was induced by many plant hormones and environmental stresses, suggesting a function of this gene in root system plasticity in response to various signals. Furthermore, AGL21 was found positively regulating auxin accumulation in lateral root primordia and lateral roots by enhancing local auxin biosynthesis, thus stimulating lateral root initiation and growth. We propose that AGL21 may be involved in various environmental and physiological signals-mediated lateral root development and growth.

AB  - Seed germination is a crucial checkpoint for plant survival under unfavorable environmental conditions. Abscisic acid (ABA) signaling plays a vital role in integrating environmental information to regulate seed germination. It has been well known that MCM1/AGAMOUS/DEFICIENS/SRF (MADS)-box transcription factors are key regulators of seed and flower development in Arabidopsis. However, little is known about their functions in seed germination. Here we report that MADS-box transcription factor AGL21 is a negative regulator of seed germination and post-germination growth by controlling the expression of ABA-INSENSITIVE 5 (ABI5) in Arabidopsis. The AGL21-overexpressing plants were hypersensitive to ABA, salt, and osmotic stresses during seed germination and early post-germination growth, whereas agl21 mutants were less sensitive. We found that AGL21 positively regulated ABI5 expression in seeds. Consistently, genetic analyses showed that AGL21 is epistatic to ABI5 in controlling seed germination. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays further demonstrated that AGL21 could directly bind to the ABI5 promoter in plant cells. Moreover, we found that AGL21 responded to multiple environmental stresses and plant hormones during seed germination. Taken together, our results suggest that AGL21 acts as a surveillance integrator that incorporates environmental cues and endogenous hormonal signals into ABA signaling to regulate seed germination and early post-germination growth.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Flowering time is important due to its roles in plant adaptation to different environments and subsequent formation of crop yield. Changes in light quality affect a range of developmental processes including flowering time, but little is known about light quality-induced flowering time control in lentil. This study aims to investigate the genetic basis for differences in flowering response to light quality in lentil. METHODS: We explored variation in flowering time caused by changes in red/far-red-related light quality environments of a lentil interspecific recombinant inbred line (RIL) population developed from a cross between Lens culinaris cv. Lupa and L. orientalis accession BGE 016880. A genetic linkage map was constructed and then used for identifying quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with flowering time regulation under different light quality environments. Differential gene expression analysis through transcriptomic study and RT-qPCR were used to identify potential candidate genes. KEY RESULTS: QTL mapping located 13 QTLs controlling flower time under different light quality environments, with phenotypic variance explained ranging from 1.7 to 62.9 %. Transcriptomic profiling and gene expression analysis for both parents of this interspecific RIL population identified flowering-related genes showing environment-specific differential expression (flowering DEGs). One of these, a member of the florigen gene family FTa1 (LcFTa1), was located close to three major QTLs. Furthermore, gene expression results suggested that two other florigen genes (LcFTb1 and LcFTb2), MADS-box transcription factors such as LcAGL6/13d, LcSVPb, LcSOC1b and LcFULb, as well as bHLH transcription factor LcPIF6 and Gibberellin 20 oxidase LcGA20oxC,G may also be involved in the light quality response. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that a major component of flowering time sensitivity to light quality is tightly linked to LcFTa1 and associated with changes in its expression. This work provides a foundation for crop improvement of lentil with better adaptation to variable light environments.

AB  - GmFULa improved soybean yield by enhancing carbon assimilation. Meanwhile, different from known yield-related genes, it did not alter flowering time or maturity. Soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) is highly demanded by a continuously growing human population. However, increasing soybean yield is a major challenge. FRUITFULL (FUL), a MADS-box transcription factor, plays important roles in multiple developmental processes, especially fruit and pod development, which are crucial for soybean yield formation. However, the functions of its homologs in soybean are not clear. Here, through haplotype analysis, we found that one haplotype of the soybean homolog GmFULa (GmFULa-H02) is dominant in cultivated soybeans, suggesting that GmFULa-H02 was highly selected during domestication and varietal improvement of soybean. Interestingly, transgenic overexpression of GmFULa enhanced vegetative growth with more biomass accumulated and ultimately increased the yield but without affecting the plant height or changing the flowering time and maturity, indicating that it enhances the efficiency of dry matter accumulation. It also promoted the yield factors like branch number, pod number and 100-seed weight, which ultimately increased the yield. It increased the palisade tissue cell number and the chlorophyll content to promote photosynthesis and increase the soluble sugar content in leaves and fresh seeds. Furthermore, GmFULa were found to be sublocalized in the nucleus and positively regulate sucrose synthases (SUSs) and sucrose transporters (SUTs) by binding with the conserved CArG boxes in their promoters. Overall, these results showed GmFULa promotes the capacity of assimilation and the transport of the resultant assimilates to increase yield, and provided insights into the link between GmFULa and sucrose synthesis with transport-related molecular pathways that control seed yield.

AB  - The winter-annual habit of Arabidopsis thaliana requires active alleles of flowering locus C (FLC), which encodes a potent flowering repressor, and FRIGIDA (FRI), an activator of FLC. FLC activation by FRI is accompanied by an increase in specific histone modifications, such as tri-methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3), and requires three H3K4 methyltransferases, the Drosophila Trithorax-class Arabidopsis trithorax1 (ATX1) and ATX2, and yeast Set1-class ATX-related7/set domain group25 (ATXR7/SDG25). However, lesions in all of these genes failed to suppress the enhanced FLC expression caused by FRI completely, suggesting that another H3K4 methyltransferase may participate in the FLC activation. Here, we show that ATXR3/SDG2, which is a member of a novel class of H3K4 methyltransferases, also contributes to FLC activation. An ATXR3 lesion suppressed the enhanced FLC expression and delayed flowering caused by an active allele of FRI in non-vernalized plants. The decrease in FLC expression in atxr3 mutants was accompanied by reduced H3K4me3 levels at FLC chromatin. We also found that the rapid flowering of atxr3 was epistatic to that of atxr7, suggesting that ATXR3 functions in FLC activation in sequence with ATXR7. Our results indicate that the novel-class H3K4 methyltransferase, ATXR3, is a transcriptional activator that plays a role in the FLC activation and establishing the winter-annual habit. In addition, ATXR3 also contributes to the activation of other FLC clade members, such as flowering locus M/MADS affecting flowering1 (FLM/MAF1) and MAF5, at least partially explaining the ATXR3 function in delayed flowering caused by non-inductive photoperiods.

AB  - To explore the differences between the hypericum in the Changbai Mountains, we carried out a transcriptome analysis of two common hypericums in the area, which was Hypericum attenuatum Choisy and Hypericum longistylum Oliv. We screened the MADS-box genes to analyze divergence time and evolutionary selection expression, and determine their expression levels. The results showed that we detected 9287 differentially expressed genes in the two species, of which shared 6044 genes by the two species. Analysis of the selected MADS genes revealed that the species was in an environment adapted to its natural evolution. The divergence time estimation showed that the segregation of these genes in the two species was related to the changes of external environment and genome replication events. The results of relative expression showed that the later flowering period of Hypericum attenuatum Choisy was related to the higher expression of the SVP (SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE) and the AGL12 (AGAMOUS LIKE 12), while the lower expression of the FUL (FRUITFULL).

AB  - MADS-box genes encode transcription factors that regulate different processes of early and late floral development. A novel type of MADS-box gene, DEFH125, was isolated from a stamen specific cDNA library from Antirrhinum majus. The DEFH125 protein shows extensive similarity over the entire length to AGL17, a root-specific MADS-box protein of Arabidopsis. By sharing amino acid deviations from the consensus MADS-box sequence not found in other MADS-box families, these two proteins constitute a novel MADS-box subfamily. However, in contrast to members of other subfamilies the overall structural similarity between the DEFH125 and AGL17 proteins does not coincide with a similarity of expression patterns and functions. The DEFH125 gene is expressed at detectable levels only in the third whorl when the meiotic division of the pollen mother cell is already accomplished. The DEFH125 protein has been located in the cytoplasm of the vegetative cell within the maturing pollen. Surprisingly, after pollination, the DEFH125 protein is also found in nuclei of cells within the transmitting tract of the carpel. The intriguing role of DEFH125, the first MADS-box transcription factor of this type, in aspects of fertilization, such as pollen maturation, pollen tube formation or pollen tube guidance in the carpel, is discussed.

AB  - The moment at which a plant transitions to reproductive development is paramount to its life cycle and is strictly controlled by many genes. The transcription factor SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 (SOC1) plays a central role in this process in Arabidopsis. However, the role of SOC1 in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) has been sparsely studied. Here, we investigated the function of four tomato SOC1 homologs in the floral transition and inflorescence development. We thoroughly characterized the SOC1-like clade throughout the Solanaceae and selected four tomato homologs that are dynamically expressed upon the floral transition. We show that of these homologs, TOMATO MADS 3 (TM3) and SISTER OF TM3 (STM3) promote the primary and sympodial transition to flowering, while MADS-BOX PROTEIN 23 (MBP23) and MBP18 hardly contribute to flowering initiation in the indeterminate cultivar Moneyberg. Protein-protein interaction assays and whole-transcriptome analysis during reproductive meristem development revealed that TM3 and STM3 interact and share many targets with FRUITFULL (FUL) homologs, including cytokinin regulators. Furthermore, we observed that mutating TM3/STM3 affects inflorescence development, but counteracts the inflorescence-branching phenotype of ful2 mbp20. Collectively, this indicates that TM3/STM3 promote the floral transition together with FUL2/MBP20, while these transcription factors have opposite functions in inflorescence development.

AB  - Members of the SEPALLATA (SEP) MADS-box subfamily are required for specifying the "floral state" by contributing to floral organ and meristem identity. SEP genes have not been detected in gymnosperms and seem to have originated since the lineage leading to extant angiosperms diverged from extant gymnosperms. Therefore, both functional and evolutionary studies suggest that SEP genes may have been critical for the origin of the flower. To gain insights into the evolution of SEP genes, we isolated nine genes from plants that occupy phylogenetically important positions. Phylogenetic analyses of SEP sequences show that several gene duplications occurred during the evolution of this subfamily, providing potential opportunities for functional divergence. The first duplication occurred prior to the origin of the extant angiosperms, resulting in the AGL2/3/4 and AGL9 clades. Subsequent duplications occurred within these clades in the eudicots and monocots. The timing of the first SEP duplication approximately coincides with duplications in the DEFICIENS/GLOBOSA and AGAMOUS MADS-box subfamilies, which may have resulted from either a proposed genome-wide duplication in the ancestor of extant angiosperms or multiple independent duplication events. Regardless of the mechanism of gene duplication, these pairs of duplicate transcription factors provided new possibilities of genetic interactions that may have been important in the origin of the flower.

AB  - The MADS-box gene AGAMOUS (AG) plays a key role in determining floral meristem and organ identities. We identified three AG homologs, EScaAG1, EScaAG2, and EScaAGL11 from the basal eudicot Eschscholzia californica (California poppy). Phylogenetic analyses indicate that EScaAG1 and EScaAG2 are recent paralogs within the AG clade, independent of the duplication in ancestral core eudicots that gave rise to the euAG and PLENA (PLE) orthologs. EScaAGL11 is basal to core eudicot AGL11 orthologs in a clade representing an older duplication event after the divergence of the angiosperm and gymnosperm lineages. Detailed in situ hybridization experiments show that expression of EScaAG1 and EScaAG2 is similar to AG; however, both genes appear to be expressed earlier in floral development than described in the core eudicots. A thorough examination of available expression and functional data in a phylogenetic context for members of the AG and AGL11 clades reveals that gene expression has been quite variable throughout the evolutionary history of the AG subfamily and that ovule-specific expression might have evolved more than twice. Although sub- and neofunctionalization are inferred to have occurred following gene duplication, functional divergence among orthologs is evident, as is convergence, among paralogs sampled from different species. We propose that retention of multiple AG homologs in several paralogous lineages can be explained by the conservation of ancestral protein activity combined with evolutionarily labile regulation of expression in the AG and AGL11 clades such that the collective functions of the AG subfamily in stamen and carpel development are maintained following gene duplication.

AB  - Ovule development is pivotal to plant reproduction and seed development. Cymbidium sinense (Orchidaceae) has high ornamental value due to its pleasant aroma and elegant floral morphology. The regulatory mechanism underlying ovule development in orchids, especially C. sinense, is largely unknown and information on the C. sinense genome is very scarce. In this study, a combined analysis was performed on the transcriptome and non-targeted metabolomes of 18 C. sinense 'Qi Jian Hei Mo' ovule samples. Transcriptome analysis assembled gene-related information related to six growth stages of C. sinense ovules (S1-S6, equivalent to 30, 35, 42, 46, 53, and 60 days after pollination). Illumina sequencing technology was used to obtain the complete set of transcriptome sequences of the 18 samples. A total of 81,585 unigene sequences were obtained after assembly, 24,860 (30.47%) of which were functionally annotated. Using transcriptome sequencing technology, a total of 9845 differentially expressed unigenes (DEUs) were identified in C. sinense ovules that were assigned to specific metabolic pathways according to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). DEUs associated with transcription factors (TFs) and phytohormones were identified and analyzed. The TFs homeobox and MADS-box were associated with C. sinense ovule development. In particular, the phytohormones associated with DEUs such as indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), cytokinin (CK), gibberellin (GA), abscisic acid (ABA), brassinosteroid (BR), and jasmonate (JA), may have important regulatory effects on C. sinense ovule development. Metabolomic analysis showed an inconsistent number of KEGG annotations of differential metabolites across comparisons (S2_vs_S4, S2_vs_S5, and S4_vs_S5 contained 23, 26, and 3 annotations, respectively) in C. sinense ovules. This study provides a valuable foundation for further understanding the regulation of orchid ovule development and formation, and establishes a theoretical background for future practical applications during orchid cultivation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The MADS-box transcription factors are an ancient family of genes that regulate numerous physiological and biochemical processes in plants and facilitate the development of floral organs. However, the functions of most of these transcription factors in soybean remain unknown. RESULTS: In this work, a MADS-box gene, GmAGL1, was overexpressed in soybean. Phenotypic analysis showed that GmAGL1 overexpression not only resulted in early maturation but also promoted flowering and affected petal development. Furthermore, the GmAGL1 was much more effective at promoting flowering under long-day conditions than under short-day conditions. Transcriptome sequencing analysis showed that before flowering, the photoperiod pathway photoreceptor CRY2 and several circadian rhythm genes, such as SPA1, were significantly down-regulated, while some other flowering-promoting circadian genes, such as GI and LHY, and downstream genes related to flower development, such as FT, LEAFY, SEP1, SEP3, FUL, and AP1, were up-regulated compared with the control. Other genes related to the flowering pathway were not noticeably affected. CONCLUSIONS: The findings reported herein indicate that GmAGL1 may promote flowering mainly through the photoperiod pathway. Interestingly, while overexpression of GmAGL1 promoted plant maturity, no reduction in seed production or oil and protein contents was observed.

AB  - GLOBOSA (GLO), a B-class MADS-box gene, is involved in floral organ determination but has rarely been studied in Osmanthus fragrans, which is a very popular ornamental tree species in China. Here, the full-length cDNA of a homologous GLO1 gene (named OfGLO1) was cloned from a flower bud of O. fragrans using the RACE technique. The OfGLO1 has a 645 bp open reading frame, encoding 214 amino acids. Similar to other PI/GLO proteins, OfGLO1 has two conserved domains, MADS MEF2-like and K-box, and a 16-amino-acid PI motif in the C terminal region. Our phylogeny analysis classified OfGLO1 as a PI-type member of the B-class MADS-box gene family. The qRT-PCR assay showed that the expression of OfGLO1 in O. fragrans was continuously upregulated from the tight bud stage to the full flowering stage but barely expressed in the pistils, sepals, and non-floral organs, such as root, leaf, and stem. The genetic effect of OfGLO1 was assayed by ectopic expression in tobacco plants. Compared with the wild-type, OfGLO1 transformants showed reduced plant size, earlier flowering, shorter stamens, and lower seed setting rates. Furthermore, some stamens were changed into petal-like structures. These findings indicate that OfGLO1 plays an important role in the regulation of flower development. This study improved our understanding of class B gene function in woody plants.

AB  - Soybean (Glycine max) is highly sensitive to photoperiod, which affects flowering time and plant architecture and thus limits the distribution range of elite soybean cultivars. The major maturity gene E1 confers the most prominent effect on photoperiod sensitivity, but its downstream signaling pathway remains largely unknown. Here, we confirm that the encoded E1 protein is a transcriptional repressor. The expression of seven GmMDE genes (Glycine max MADS-box genes downregulated by E1) was suppressed when E1 was overexpressed and promoted when E1 was knocked out through clustered regularly-interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR associated protein 9 (Cas9)-mediated mutagenesis. These GmMDEs exhibited similar tissue specificity and expression patterns, including in response to photoperiod, E1 expression, and E1 genotype. E1 repressed GmMDE promoter activity. Results for two GmMDEs showed that E1 epigenetically silences their expression by directly binding to their promoters to increase H3K27me3 levels. The overexpression of GmMDE06 promoted flowering and post-flowering termination of stem growth. The late flowering phenotype of E1-overexpressing soybean lines was reversed by the overexpression of GmMDE06, placing GmMDE06 downstream of E1. The overexpression of GmMDE06 increased the expression of the soybean FLOWERING LOCUS T orthologs GmFT2a and GmFT5a, leading to feedback upregulation of GmMDE, indicating that GmMDE and GmFT2a/GmFT5a form a positive regulatory feedback loop promoting flowering. GmMDE06 also promoted post-flowering termination of stem growth by repressing the expression of the shoot identity gene Dt1. The E1-GmMDEs-GmFT2a/5a-Dt1 signaling pathway illustrates how soybean responds to photoperiod by modulating flowering time and post-flowering stem termination.

AB  - AP3 has been studied and is reported to affect structural changes in floral organs in various plants. However, the function of the soybean AP3 genes in flower development is unknown. Here, the full-length cDNA sequence of GmAP3 was obtained by RACE and it was verified that it belongs to the MADS-box subfamily by a bioinformatics analysis. The expression of GmAP3 is closely related to the expression of essential enzyme genes related to flower development. Yeast two-hybrid assays demonstrated that GmAP3 interacts with AP1 to determine the identity of flower organ development. A follow-up analysis showed that overexpression of the GmAP3 gene advanced flowering time and resulted in changes in floral organ morphology. The average flowering time of overexpressed soybean and tobacco plants was 6-8 days earlier than that of wild-type plants, and the average flowering time of gene-edited soybean and tobacco plants was 6-11 days later than that of wild-type plants. In conclusion, GmAP3 may directly or indirectly affect the flower development of soybean. The results of this study lay the foundation for further research on the biological functions of MADS transcriptional factors in soybeans.

AB  - A MADS-box gene (PdPI) was isolated from a cDNA library constructed from male flower buds of Populus deltoides Bartr. ex Marsh. According to an analysis of genomic DNA structure and putative protein structure, and a phylogenetic study, PdPI is an ortholog of the Arabidopsis PI gene. Relative-quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that PdPI has a broader expression pattern than PI in Arabidopsis. PdPI was strongly expressed in floral buds and roots and weakly expressed in immature xylem, leaves and apical buds of the male P. deltoides tree. In male inflorescences, PdPI expression was abundant in the perianth and anther, and weak in the peduncle and mature pollen. The large differences in PdPI expression at various phases of male floral bud development were closely related to the development of flower organs (perianth and stamen) and pollen. PdPI was also expressed in female inflorescences. Our results suggest that PdPI has multiple functions in the development of P. deltoides.

AB  - Members of AP1/FUL subfamily genes play an essential role in the regulation of floral meristem transition, floral organ identity, and fruit ripping. At present, there have been insufficient studies to explain the function of the AP1/FUL-like subfamily genes in Asteraceae. Here, we cloned two euAP1 clade genes TeAP1-1 and TeAP1-2, and three euFUL clade genes TeFUL1, TeFUL2, and TeFUL3 from marigold (Tagetes erecta L.). Expression profile analysis demonstrated that TeAP1-1 and TeAP1-2 were mainly expressed in receptacles, sepals, petals, and ovules. TeFUL1 and TeFUL3 were expressed in flower buds, stems, and leaves, as well as reproductive tissues, while TeFUL2 was mainly expressed in flower buds and vegetative tissues. Overexpression of TeAP1-2 or TeFUL2 in Arabidopsis resulted in early flowering, implying that these two genes might regulate the floral transition. Yeast two-hybrid analysis indicated that TeAP1/FUL proteins only interacted with TeSEP proteins to form heterodimers and that TeFUL2 could also form a homodimer. In general, TeAP1-1 and TeAP1-2 might play a conserved role in regulating sepal and petal identity, similar to the functions of MADS-box class A genes, while TeFUL genes might display divergent functions. This study provides a theoretical basis for the study of AP1/FUL-like genes in Asteraceae species.

AB  - BACKGROUND: AGAMOUS (AG) subfamily genes regulate the floral organs initiation and development, fruit and seed development. At present, there has been insufficient study of the function of AG subfamily genes in Asteraceae. Marigold (Tagetes erecta) belongs to Asteraceae family whose unique inflorescence structure makes it an important research target for understanding floral organ development in plants. RESULTS: Four AG subfamily genes of marigold were isolated and phylogenetically grouped into class C (TeAG1 and TeAG2) and class D (TeAGL11-1 and TeAGL11-2) genes. Expression profile analysis demonstrated that these four genes were highly expressed in reproductive organs of marigold. Subcellular localization analysis suggested that all these four proteins were located in the nucleus. Protein-protein interactions analysis indicated that class C proteins had a wider interaction manner than class D proteins. Function analysis of ectopic expression in Arabidopsis thaliana revealed that TeAG1 displayed a C function specifying the stamen identity and carpel identity, and that TeAGL11-1 exhibited a D function regulating seed development and petal development. In addition, overexpression of both TeAG1 and TeAGL11-1 leaded to curling rosette leaf and early flowering in Arabidopsis thaliana. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides an insight into molecular mechanism of AG subfamily genes in Asteraceae species and technical support for improvement of several floral traits.

AB  - The development of plant root systems is sensitive to the availability and distribution of nutrients within the soil. For example, lateral roots proliferate preferentially within nitrate (NO3-)-rich soil patches. A NO3--inducible Arabidopsis gene (ANR1), was identified that encodes a member of the MADS box family of transcription factors. Transgenic plants in which ANR1 was repressed had an altered sensitivity to NO3- and no longer responded to NO3--rich zones by lateral root proliferation, indicating that ANR1 is a key determinant of developmental plasticity in Arabidopsis roots.

AB  - MADS-box transcription factor genes are well known for their role in floral organ and seed development. In this study, a novel MADS-box-containing gene, designated NbMADS1, was isolated from leaves of Nicotiana benthamiana. The full-length cDNA was 666 bp and encoded a putative polypeptide of 221 aa with a mass of 24.3 kDa. To assess the role of NbMADS1 in the defence response to bacterial harpin(Xoo), an elicitor of the hypersensitive response, a loss-of-function experiment was performed in N. benthamiana plants using virus-induced gene silencing. Analyses of electrolyte leakage revealed more extensive cell death in the control plants than in NbMADS1-silenced plants. The NbMADS1-silenced plants showed impaired harpin(Xoo)-induced stomatal closure, decreased harpin(Xoo)-induced production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and nitric oxide (NO) in guard cells, and reduced harpin(Xoo)-induced resistance to Phytophthora nicotianae. The compromised stomatal closure observed in the NbMADS1-silenced plants was inhibited by the application of H2O2 and sodium nitroprusside (an NO donor). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the NbMADS1-H2O2-NO pathway mediates multiple harpin(Xoo)-triggered responses, including stomatal closure, hypersensitive cell death, and defence-related gene expression, suggesting that NbMADS1 plays an important role in regulating the response to harpin(Xoo) in N. benthamiana plants.

AB  - The MADS-box transcription factors play essential roles in many physiological and biochemical processes of plants, especially in fruit ripening. Here, a tomato MADS-box gene, SlCMB1, was isolated. SlCMB1 expression declined with the fruit ripening from immature green to B + 7 (7 days after Breaker) fruits in the wild type (WT) and was lower in Nr and rin mutants fruits. Tomato plants with reduced SlCMB1 mRNA displayed delayed fruit ripening, reduced ethylene production and carotenoid accumulation. The ethylene production in SlCMB1-RNAi fruits decreased by approximately 50% as compared to WT. The transcripts of ethylene biosynthesis genes (ACS2, ACS4, ACO1 and ACO3), ethylene-responsive genes (E4, E8 and ERF1) and fruit ripening-related genes (RIN, TAGL1, FUL1, FUL2, LoxC and PE) were inhibited in SlCMB1-RNAi fruits. The carotenoid accumulation was decreased and two carotenoid synthesis-related genes (PSY1 and PDS) were down-regulated while three lycopene cyclase genes (CYCB, LCYB and LCYE) were up-regulated in transgenic fruits. Furthermore, yeast two-hybrid assay showed that SlCMB1 could interact with SlMADS-RIN, SlMADS1, SlAP2a and TAGL1, respectively. Collectively, these results indicate that SlCMB1 is a new component to the current model of regulatory network that regulates ethylene biosynthesis and carotenoid accumulation during fruit ripening.

AB  - AGAMOUS (AG) MADS-box transcription factors have been shown to play crucial roles in floral organ and fruit development in angiosperms. Here, we isolated a tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) AG MADS-box gene SlMBP3 and found that it is preferentially expressed in flowers and during early fruit developmental stages in the wild-type (WT), and in the Nr (never ripe) and rin (ripening inhibitor) mutants. Its transcripts are notably accumulated in the pistils; transcripts abundance decrease during seed and placental development, increasing again during flower development. SlMBP3-RNAi tomato plants displayed fleshy placenta without locular gel and extremely malformed seeds with no seed coat, while SlMBP3-overexpressing plants exhibited advanced liquefaction of the placenta and larger seeds. Enzymatic activities related to cell wall modification, and the contents of cell wall components and pigments were dramatically altered in the placentas of SlMBP3-RNAi compared with the WT. Alterations in these physiological features were also observed in the placentas of SlMBP3-overexpressing plants. The lignin content of mature seeds in SlMBP3-RNAi lines was markedly lower than that in the WT. RNA-seq and qRT-PCR analyses revealed that genes involved in seed development and the biosynthesis of enzymes related to cell wall modification, namely gibberellin, indole-3-acetic acid, and abscisic acid were down-regulated in the SlMBP3-RNAi lines. Taking together, our results demonstrate that SlMBP3 is involved in the regulation of placenta and seed development in tomato.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cymbidium sinense belongs to the Orchidaceae, which is one of the most abundant angiosperm families. C. sinense, a high-grade traditional potted flower, is most prevalent in China and some Southeast Asian countries. The control of flowering time is a major bottleneck in the industrialized development of C. sinense. Little is known about the mechanisms responsible for floral development in this orchid. Moreover, genome references for entire transcriptome sequences do not currently exist for C. sinense. Thus, transcriptome and expression profiling data for this species are needed as an important resource to identify genes and to better understand the biological mechanisms of floral development in C. sinense. RESULTS: In this study, de novo transcriptome assembly and gene expression analysis using Illumina sequencing technology were performed. Transcriptome analysis assembles gene-related information related to vegetative and reproductive growth of C. sinense. Illumina sequencing generated 54,248,006 high quality reads that were assembled into 83,580 unigenes with an average sequence length of 612 base pairs, including 13,315 clusters and 70,265 singletons. A total of 41,687 (49.88%) unique sequences were annotated, 23,092 of which were assigned to specific metabolic pathways by the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of the annotated unigenes revealed that the majority of sequenced genes were associated with metabolic and cellular processes, cell and cell parts, catalytic activity and binding. Furthermore, 120 flowering-associated unigenes, 73 MADS-box unigenes and 28 CONSTANS-LIKE (COL) unigenes were identified from our collection. In addition, three digital gene expression (DGE) libraries were constructed for the vegetative phase (VP), floral differentiation phase (FDP) and reproductive phase (RP). The specific expression of many genes in the three development phases was also identified. 32 genes among three sub-libraries with high differential expression were selected as candidates connected with flower development. CONCLUSION: RNA-seq and DGE profiling data provided comprehensive gene expression information at the transcriptional level that could facilitate our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of floral development at three development phases of C. sinense. This data could be used as an important resource for investigating the genetics of the flowering pathway and various biological mechanisms in this orchid.

AB  - Ethylene signaling pathways regulate several physiological alterations that occur during tomato fruit ripening, such as changes in colour and flavour. The mechanisms underlying the transcriptional regulation of genes in these pathways remain unclear, although the role of the MADS-box transcription factor RIN has been widely reported. Here, we describe a bHLH transcription factor, SlbHLH95, whose transcripts accumulated abundantly in breaker+4 and breaker+7 fruits compared with rin (ripening inhibitor) and Nr (never ripe) mutants. Moreover, the promoter activity of SlbHLH95 was regulated by RIN in vivo. Suppression of SlbHLH95 resulted in reduced sensitivity to ethylene, decreased accumulation of total carotenoids, and lowered glutathione content, and inhibited the expression of fruit ripening- and glutathione metabolism-related genes. Conversely, up-regulation of SlbHLH95 in wild-type tomato resulted in higher sensitivity to ethylene, increased accumulation of total carotenoids, slightly premature ripening, and elevated accumulation of glutathione, soluble sugar, and starch. Notably, overexpression of SlbHLH95 in rin led to the up-regulated expression of fruit ripening-related genes (FUL1, FUL2, SAUR69, ERF4, and CNR) and multiple glutathione metabolism-related genes (GSH1, GSH2, GSTF1, and GSTF5). These results clarified that SlbHLH95 participates in the regulation of fruit ripening and affects ethylene sensitivity and multiple metabolisms targeted by RIN in tomato.

AB  - Due to a scarcity of relevant data, the ornamental woody flower Rhododendron delavayi Franch. is examined in the current study for its low temperature-induced floral bud dormancy (late October-end December) aspect. This study used transcriptome data profiling and co-expression network analyses to identify the interplay between endogenous hormones and bud dormancy phases such as pre-dormancy, para-dormancy, endo-dormancy, eco-dormancy, and dormancy release. The biochemical and physiological assays revealed the significance of the abundance of phytohormones (abscisic acid, auxin, zeatin, and gibberellins), carbohydrate metabolism, oxidative species, and proteins (soluble proteins, proline, and malondialdehyde) in the regulatory mechanism of floral bud dormancy. The transcriptome sequencing generated 65,531 transcripts, out of which 504, 514, 307, and 240 expressed transcripts were mapped uniquely to pre-, para-, endo-, and eco-phases of dormancy, showing their roles in the stimulation of dormancy. The transcripts related to LEA29, PGM, SAUR family, RPL9e, ATRX, FLOWERING LOCUS T, SERK1, ABFs, ASR2, and GID1 were identified as potential structural genes involved in floral bud dormancy. The transcription factors, including Zinc fingers, CAD, MADS-box family, MYB, and MYC2, revealed their potential regulatory roles concerning floral bud dormancy. The gene co-expression analysis highlighted essential hub genes involved in cold stress adaptations encoding proteins, viz, SERPIN, HMA, PMEI, LEA_2, TRX, PSBT, and AMAT. We exposed the connection among low temperature-induced dormancy in floral buds, differentially expressed genes, and hub genes via strict screening steps to escalate the confidence in selected genes as being truly putative in the pathways regulating bud dormancy mechanism. The identified candidate genes may prove worthy of further in-depth studies on molecular mechanisms involved in floral bud dormancy of Rhododendron species.

AB  - The MADS-box gene plays an important role in regulating plant growth and development. In this study, a SEP3-like MADS-box gene TaSEP3-1 was isolated from bread wheat. The expression patterns of the three homoeologs TaSEP3-A1, TaSEP3-B1, and TaSEP3-D1 were similar, and higher expression levels were detected in floral organs and developing kernels. TaSEP3-D1 was located in the nucleus and cytoplasm and possessed transactivation activity in yeast. Homoeolog sequence polymorphism analysis identified four, three, and four haplotypes of TaSEP3-A1, TaSEP3-B1, and TaSEP3-D1, respectively, and the haplotypes of TaSEP3-D1 had larger effects on agronomic traits than those of TaSEP3-A1 and TaSEP3-B1. D1_h4, significantly associated with heading date, plant height, and other yield-related traits, was the favored haplotype of TaSEP3-D1. Transgenic wheat genotypes overexpressing TaSEP3-D1 exhibited delayed heading and reduced plant height, indicating a role in regulating heading date and plant development. These results shed light on the role of TaSEP3-D1 in wheat plant development. The favored haplotype of TaSEP3-D1 can be applied in breeding to improve plant architecture and yield in wheat.

AB  - Oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) is one of the most important oil crops in the world, and compared to all oil crops, it has the highest productive efficiency. In the present study, a MADS-box transcription factor of the AGAMOUS class, named EgAGL9, was identified by expression profile analysis in the different developmental stages of oil palm mesocarp. Real-time quantitative PCR results confirmed that the expression of EgAGL9 increased rapidly during the last stages of oil palm mesocarp development. Then, three downstream genes, including EgSAD (Stearoyl-ACP desaturase), EgTSA (Tryptophan synthase) and EgSDH (Succinate dehydrogenase), were screened by ChIP-Seq and data analysis. EMSA analysis verified that EgAGL9 interacted with the promoter regions of EgSAD, EgTSA and EgSDH. Moreover, the expression levels of EgSAD, EgTSA and EgSDH were downregulated in EgAGL9-overexpressing protoplasts and calli of oil palm. Compared to WT, the total lipid content and ratio of unsaturated fatty acids in transgenic calli (including oleic acid, linoleic acid and linolenic acid) were significantly decreased. Together, these results revealed that these three EgAGL9-regulated genes are involved in regulatory pathways in the oil palm mesocarp. Compared with previous studies, the present study provides a new research strategy for understanding of the molecular regulatory pathways of lipid metabolism in mesocarp of oil palm. The obtained results will bring a new perspective for a comprehensive understanding of the regulation of the metabolic accumulation in the oil palm mesocarp.

AB  - Early endosperm development presents a unique system in which to uncover epigenetic regulatory mechanisms because the contributing maternal and paternal genomes possess differential epigenetic modifications. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), the initiation of endosperm coenocytic growth upon fertilization and the transition to endosperm cellularization are regulated by the FERTILIZATION-INDEPENDENT SEED (FIS)-Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), a putative H3K27 methyltransferase. Here, we address the possible role of the FIS-PRC2 complex in regulating the type I MADS-box gene family, which has been shown previously to regulate early endosperm development. We show that a subclass of type I MADS-box genes (C2 genes) was expressed in distinct domains of the coenocytic endosperm in wild-type seeds. Furthermore, the C2 genes were mostly up-regulated biallelically during the extended coenocytic phase of endosperm development in the FIS-PRC2 mutant background. Using allele-specific expression analysis, we also identified a small subset of C2 genes subjected to FIS-PRC2-dependent maternal or FIS-PRC2-independent paternal imprinting. Our data support a dual role for the FIS-PRC2 complex in the regulation of C2 type I MADS-box genes, as evidenced by a generalized role in the repression of gene expression at both alleles associated with endosperm cellularization and a specialized role in silencing the maternal allele of imprinted genes.

AB  - Seedless grapes are increasingly popular throughout the world, and the development of seedless varieties is a major breeding goal. In this study, we demonstrate an essential role for the grapevine MADS-box gene VvMADS28 in morphogenesis of the ovule. We found that VvMADS28 mRNA accumulated in the ovules of a seeded cultivar, 'Red Globe', throughout the course of ovule and seed development, especially within the integument/seed coat. In contrast, in the seedless cultivar 'Thompson Seedless', VvMADS28 was expressed only weakly in ovules, and this was associated with increased levels of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) within the VvMADS28 promoter region. RNAi-mediated transient suppression of VvMADS28 expression in 'Red Globe' led to reduced seed size associated with inhibition of episperm and endosperm cell development. Heterologous overexpression of VvMADS28 in transgenic tomatoes interfered with sepal development and resulted in smaller fruit but did not obviously affect seed size. Assays in yeast cells showed that VvMADS28 is subject to regulation by the transcription factor VvERF98, and that VvMADS28 could interact with the Type I/ Mbeta MADS-domain protein VvMADS5. Moreover, through DNA-affinity purification-sequencing (DAP-seq), we found that VvMADS28 protein specifically binds to the promoter of the grapevine WUSCHEL (VvWUS) gene, suggesting that maintenance of the VvMADS28-VvMADS5 dimer and VvWUS expression homeostasis influences seed development. Taken together, our results provide insight into regulatory mechanisms of ovule and seed development associated with VvMADS28.

AB  - Seedlessness is one of the most important breeding goals for table grapes; thus, understanding the molecular genetic regulation of seed development and abortion is critical for the development of seedless cultivars. In the present study, we characterized VvMADS39, a class E MADS-box gene of grapevine (Vitis vinifera) orthologous to Arabidopsis SEP2. Heterologous overexpression of VvMADS39 in tomato reduced the fruit and seed size and seed number. Targeted mutagenesis of the homologous SlMADS39 in tomato induced various floral and fruit defects. It could reasonable to suppose that active VvMADS39 expression in "Thompson Seedless" may restrict cellular expansion, resulting in the development of smaller fruits and seeds, VvMADS39 may play a role in the regulation of ovule development in grapevine and contributes to seedless fruit formation. In contrast, VvMADS39 suppression in "Red Globe" was associated with enhanced histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation in the promoter region of VvMADS39, allowing normal ovule and fruit development; Meanwhile, VvMADS39 interacts with VvAGAMOUS, and the activity of the VvMADS39-VvAGAMOUS dimer to induce integument development requires the activation and maintenance of VvINO expression. The synergistic cooperation between VvMADS39 and related proteins plays an important role in maintaining floral meristem characteristics, and fruit and ovule development.

AB  - The pseudanthial inflorescences of the sunflower family, Asteraceae, mimic a solitary flower but are composed of multiple flowers. Our studies in Gerbera hybrida indicate functional diversification for SEPALLATA (SEP)-like MADS box genes that often function redundantly in other core eudicots. We conducted phylogenetic and expression analysis for eight SEP-like GERBERA REGULATOR OF CAPITULUM DEVELOPMENT (GRCD) genes, including previously unstudied gene family members. Transgenic gerbera plants were used to infer gene functions. Adding to the previously identified stamen and carpel functions for GRCD1 and GRCD2, two partially redundant genes, GRCD4 and GRCD5, were found to be indispensable for petal development. Stepwise conversion of floral organs into leaves in the most severe RNA interference lines suggest redundant and additive GRCD activities in organ identity regulation. We show conserved and redundant functions for several GRCD genes in regulation of flower meristem maintenance, while functional diversification for three SEP1/2/4 clade genes in regulation of inflorescence meristem patterning was observed. GRCD genes show both specialized and pleiotropic functions contributing to organ differentiation and flower meristem fate, and uniquely, to patterning of the inflorescence meristem. Altogether, we provide an example of how plant reproductive evolution has used conserved genetic modules for regulating the elaborate inflorescence architecture in Asteraceae.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pineapple is the most important crop with CAM photosynthesis, but its molecular biology is underexplored. MADS-box genes are crucial transcription factors involving in plant development and several biological processes. However, there is no systematic analysis of MADS-box family genes in pineapple (Ananas comosus). RESULTS: Forty-eight MADS-box genes were identified in the pineapple genome. Based on the phylogenetic studies, pineapple MADS-box genes can be divided into type I and type II MADS-box genes. Thirty-four pineapple genes were classified as type II MADS-box genes including 32 MIKC-type and 2 Mdelta-type, while 14 type I MADS-box genes were further divided into Malpha, Mbeta and Mgamma subgroups. A majority of pineapple MADS-box genes were randomly distributed across 19 chromosomes. RNA-seq expression patterns of MADS-box genes in four different tissues revealed that more genes were highly expressed in flowers, which was confirmed by our quantitative RT-PCR results. There is no FLC and CO orthologs in pineapple. The loss of FLC and CO orthologs in pineapple indicated that modified flowering genes network in this tropical plant compared with Arabidopsis. The expression patterns of MADS-box genes in photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic leaf tissues indicated the potential roles of some MADS-box genes in pineapple CAM photosynthesis. The 23% of pineapple MADS-box genes showed diurnal rhythm, indicating that these MADS-box genes are regulated by circadian clock. CONCLUSIONS: MADS-box genes identified in pineapple are closely related to flowering development. Some MADS-box genes are involved in CAM photosynthesis and regulated by the circadian clock. These findings will facilitate research on the development of unusual spiral inflorescences on pineapple fruit and CAM photosynthesis.

AB  - Dianthus is a large genus containing many species with high ornamental economic value. Extensive breeding strategies permitted an exploration of an improvement in the quality of cultivated carnation, particularly in flowers. However, little is known on the molecular mechanisms of flower development in carnation. Here, we report the identification and description of MADS-box genes in carnation (DcaMADS) with a focus on those involved in flower development and organ identity determination. In this study, 39 MADS-box genes were identified from the carnation genome and transcriptome by the phylogenetic analysis. These genes were categorized into four subgroups (30 MIKC(c), two MIKC*, two Malpha, and five Mgamma). The MADS-box domain, gene structure, and conserved motif compositions of the carnation MADS genes were analysed. Meanwhile, the expression of DcaMADS genes were significantly different in stems, leaves, and flower buds. Further studies were carried out for exploring the expression of DcaMADS genes in individual flower organs, and some crucial DcaMADS genes correlated with their putative function were validated. Finally, a new expression pattern of DcaMADS genes in flower organs of carnation was provided: sepal (three class E genes and two class A genes), petal (two class B genes, two class E genes, and one SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP)), stamen (two class B genes, two class E genes, and two class C), styles (two class E genes and two class C), and ovary (two class E genes, two class C, one AGAMOUS-LIKE 6 (AGL6), one SEEDSTICK (STK), one B sister, one SVP, and one Malpha). This result proposes a model in floral organ identity of carnation and it may be helpful to further explore the molecular mechanism of flower organ identity in carnation.

AB  - Eucommia ulmoides is a famous rubber-producing and medicinal tree species that produces unisexual flowers on separate individuals from the earliest stage of stamen/pistil primordium formation. To explore the genetic regulation pathway of sex in E. ulmoides, comprehensive genome-wide analyses and tissue-/sex-specific transcriptome comparisons of MADS-box transcription factors were performed for the first time in this work. Quantitative real-time PCR technique was employed to further validate the expression of genes that are assigned to floral organ ABCDE model. A total of 66 non-redundant E. ulmoides MADS-box (EuMADS) genes were identified, they were classified into Type I (M-type, 17 genes) and Type II (MIKC, 49 genes). Complex protein-motif composition, exon-intron structure and phytohormone-response cis-elements were detected in MIKC-EuMADS genes. Furthermore, 24 differentially-expressed EuMADS genes (DEGs) between male and female flowers, and two DEGs between male and female leaves were revealed. Amongst the 14 floral organ ABCDE model-related genes, there were 6 (A/B/C/E-class) and 5 (A/D/E-class) genes displayed male- and female-biased expression respectively. In particular, one B-class gene EuMADS39 and one A-class gene EuMADS65 were almost exclusively expressed in male trees, no matter in flower or leaf tissues. Collectively, these results suggested a critical role of MADS-box transcription factors in sex determination of E. ulmoides, which is conducive to decoding the molecular regulation mechanism of sex in E. ulmoides.

AB  - Lumnitzera littorea (Jack) Voigt is among the most endangered mangrove species in China. The morphology and evolution of L. littorea flowers have received substantial attention for their crucial reproductive functions. However, little is known about the genomic regulation of flower development in L. littorea. In this study, we characterized the morphology of two kinds of L. littorea flowers and performed comparative analyses of transcriptome profiles of the two different flowers. Morphological observation showed that some flowers have a column embedded in the petals while others produce a stretched flower style during petal unfolding in flowering. By using RNA-seq, we obtained 138,857 transcripts that were assembled into 82,833 unigenes with a mean length of 1055.48 bp. 82,834 and 34,997 unigenes were assigned to 52 gene ontology (GO) functional groups and 364 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, respectively. A total of 4,267 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 1,794 transcription factors (TFs), were identified between two types of flowers. These TFs are mainly involved in bHLH, B3, bZIP, MYB-related, and NAC family members. We further validated that 12 MADS-box genes, including 4 MIKC-type and 8 M-type TFs, were associated with the pollinate of L. littorea by herkogamy. Our current results provide valuable information for genetic analysis of L. littorea flowering and may be useful for illuminating its adaptive evolutionary mechanisms.

AB  - Bamboo is one of the most important non-timber forest resources worldwide. It has considerable economic value and unique flowering characteristics. The long juvenile phase in bamboo and unpredictable flowering time limit breeding and genetic improvement and seriously affect the productivity and application of bamboo forests. Members of SQUA-like subfamily genes play an essential role in controlling flowering time and floral organ identity. A comprehensive study was conducted to explain the functions of five SQUA-like subfamily genes in Phyllostachys edulis. Expression analysis revealed that all PeSQUAs have higher transcript levels in the reproductive period than in the juvenile phase. However, PeSQUAs showed divergent expression patterns during inflorescence development. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) patterns among PeSQUAs and other MADS-box members were analyzed by yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) experiments. Consistent with amino acid sequence similarity and phylogenetic analysis, the PPI patterns clustered into two groups. PeMADS2, 13, and 41 interacted with multiple PeMADS proteins, whereas PeMADS3 and 28 hardly interacted with other proteins. Based on our results, PeSQUA might possess different functions by forming protein complexes with other MADS-box proteins at different flowering stages. Furthermore, we chose PeMADS2 for functional analysis. Ectopic expression of PeMADS2 in Arabidopsis and rice caused early flowering, and abnormal phenotype was observed in transgenic Arabidopsis lines. RNA-seq analysis indicated that PeMADS2 integrated multiple pathways regulating floral transition to trigger early flowering time in rice. This function might be due to the interaction between PeMADS2 and homologous in rice. Therefore, we concluded that the five SQUA-like genes showed functional conservation and divergence based on sequence differences and were involved in floral transitions by forming protein complexes in P. edulis. The MADS-box protein complex model obtained in the current study will provide crucial insights into the molecular mechanisms of bamboo's unique flowering characteristics.

AB  - Plant flowering time is induced by environmental and endogenous signals perceived by the plant. The MCM1-AGAMOUSDEFICIENS-Serum Response Factor-box (MADS-box) protein SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) is a pivotal repressor that negatively regulates the floral transition during the vegetative phase; however, the transcriptional regulatory mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we report that CmSVP, a chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum morifolium Ramat.) homolog of SVP, can repress the expression of a key flowering gene, a chrysanthemum FLOWERING LOCUS T-like gene (CmFTL3), by binding its promoter CArG element to delay flowering in the ambient temperature pathway in chrysanthemum. Protein-protein interaction assays identified an interaction between CmSVP and CmTPL1-2, a chrysanthemum homologue of TOPLESS (TPL) that plays critical roles as transcriptional corepressor in many aspects of plant life. Genetic analyses revealed the CmSVP-CmTPL1-2 transcriptional complex is a prerequisite for CmSVP to act as a floral repressor. Furthermore, overexpression of CmSVP rescued the phenotype of the svp-31 mutant in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), overexpression of AtSVP or CmSVP in the Arabidopsis dominant-negative mutation tpl-1 led to ineffective late flowering, and AtSVP interacted with AtTPL, confirming the conserved function of SVP in chrysanthemum and Arabidopsis. We have validated a conserved machinery wherein SVP partially relies on TPL to inhibit flowering via a thermosensory pathway.

AB  - MADS-box genes encode a family of transcription factors, which control diverse developmental processes in flowering plants, with organs ranging from roots, flowers and fruits. In this study, six maize cDNAs encoding MADS-box proteins were isolated. BLASTX searches and phylogenetic analysis indicated that the six MADS-box genes belonging to the AGL2-like clade. qRT-PCR analysis revealed that these genes had differential expression patterns in different organs in maize. The results of yeast one-hybrid system indicated that the protein ZMM3-1, ZMM3-2, ZMM6, ZMM7-L, ZMM8-L and ZMM14-L had transcriptional activation activity. Subcellular localization of ZMM7-L demonstrated that the fluorescence of ZMM7-L-GFP was mainly detected in the nuclei of onion epidermal cells. qRT-PCR analysis for expression pattern of ZMM7-L showed that the gene was up-regulated by abiotic stresses and down-regulated by exogenous ABA. The germination rates of over-expression transgenic lines were lower than that of the wild type on medium with 150 mM NaCl, 350 mM mannitol. These results indicated that ZMM7-L might be a negative transcription factor responsive to abiotic stresses.

AB  - MADS-box genes are important transcription factors in eukaryotes that are involved in regulating the growth and development of many plants. Jiaobai is a special aquatic vegetable formed through the stem expansion of Zizania latifolia infected by Ustilago esculenta and is wildly cultivated in Southeast Asia. To date, the biological function of MADS-box genes in Z. latifolia remains largely unknown. In this study, a genome-wide search for MADS-box genes in Z. latifolia was performed, and 87 MADS-box genes were identified. According to the phylogenetic analysis, there were 27 type I genes and 60 type II genes. The type I genes were mainly distributed in the Mα, Mβ and Mγ subfamilies, and the type II genes were divided into 14 subfamilies and unevenly distributed across 17 chromosomes. The encoded protein sequences ranged from 91 to 433 amino acids, the number of exons was 1~14, and most type I genes did not contain introns. The promoter region contained a large number of functional domains related to light response, plant hormones, stress and the meristem. An analysis of the expression patterns showed that there were massive differences in the expression of the MADS-box genes in different tissues, with six genes highly expressed in leaves and eight genes highly expressed in the stem apical meristem. Photoperiod and temperature were found to regulate the formation of the stem gall (SG) of Z. latifolia, and short-day (SD) conditions had an obvious promoting effect. ZlMADS57 and ZlMADS85 were significantly increased in SG under SD. Further analysis of the expression levels of MADS-box genes during the developmental stages of Z. latifolia found that the ZlMADS45, ZlMADS57, ZlMADS81 and ZlMADS85 were highly expressed 10 days before the SG formation, and ZlMADS66 reached its highest value on the day when the SG began forming. ZlMADS14, ZlMADS15, ZlMADS32, ZlMADS36, ZlMADS59 and ZlMADS71 were highly expressed after SG expansion, indicating that the MADS-box gene may play an important role in regulating SG formation and the subsequent expansion of Jiaobai. This study provides a reference for the functional identification of the MADS-box gene family and establishes a foundation for regulating the maturity of Z. latifolia.

AB  - Dormancy Associated MADS-box genes are SVP/MADs-box members and supposed to play crucial roles in plant dormancy of perennial species. In Prunus mume, PmDAM6 has been previously identified to induce plant dormancy. In the current study, six PmDAMs were cloned in P. mume and functionally analyzed in yeast and tobacco to detect the roles of the genes paralogous to PmDAM6. The expression patterns together with sequence similarities indicate that PmDAMs are divided into two sub-clades within SVP group. Moreover, PmDAMs are verified to take part in the development of different plant organs, specifically the flower buds, in some intricate patterns. Furthermore, the PmDAM proteins are found to have special functions by forming corresponding protein complex during the development of flower bud and induction of dormancy. In particular, when PmDAM1 dominating in flower bud in the warm months, the protein complexes are consisted of PmDAM1 itself or with PmDAM2. With the decrease temperatures in the following months, PmDAM6 was found to be highly expressed and gradually changed the complex structure to PmDAM6-protein complex due to strong binding tendencies with PmDAM1 and PmDAM3. Finally, the homodimers of PmDAM6 prevailed to induce the dormancy. The results obtained in the current study highlight the functions of PmDAMs in the tissue development and dormancy, which provide available suggestions for further explorations of protein-complex functions in association with bud growth and dormancy.

AB  - Prunus mume (Rosaceae, Prunoideae) serves as an excellent ornamental woody plant with a large-temperature-range cultivation scope. Its flower buds require a certain low temperature to achieve flowering circulation. Thus, it is important to delve into the processes of flower bud differentiation and dormancy, which affected its continuous flowering. These processes are generally considered as regulation by the MADS-box homologs, SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP), and DORMANCY-ASSOCIATED MADS-BOX (DAM). However, a precise model on their interdependence and specific function, when acting as a complex in the flower development of P. mume, is needed. Therefore, this study highlighted the integral roles of PmDAMs and PmSVPs in flower organ development and dormancy cycle. The segregation of PmDAMs and PmSVPs in a different cluster suggested distinct functions and neofunctionalization. The expression pattern and yeast two-hybrid assays jointly revealed that eight genes were involved in the floral organ development stages, with PmDAM1 and PmDAM5 specifically related to prolificated flower formation. PmSVP1-2 mingled in the protein complex in bud dormancy stages with PmDAMs. Finally, we proposed the hypothesis that PmSVP1 and PmSVP2 could combine with PmDAM1 to have an effect on flower organogenesis and interact with PmDAM5 and PmDAM6 to regulate flower bud dormancy. These findings could help expand the current molecular mechanism based on MADS-box genes during flower bud development and dormancy.

AB  - FLOWERING LOCUS M (FLM) is a well-known MADS-box transcription factor that is required for preventing early flowering under low temperatures in Arabidopsis thaliana. Alternative splicing of FLM is involved in the regulation of temperature-responsive flowering. However, how the basic transcript level of FLM is regulated is largely unknown. Here, we conducted forward genetic screening and identified a previously uncharacterized flowering repressor gene, UBA2c. Genetic analyses indicated that UBA2c represses flowering at least by promoting FLM transcription. We further demonstrated that UBA2c directly binds to FLM chromatin and facilitates FLM transcription by inhibiting histone H3K27 trimethylation, a histone marker related to transcriptional repression. UBA2c encodes a protein containing two putative RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and one prion-like domain (PrLD). We found that UBA2c forms speckles in the nucleus and that both the RRMs and PrLD are required not only for forming the nuclear speckles but also for the biological function of UBA2c. These results identify a previously unknown flowering repressor and provide insights into the regulation of flowering time.

AB  - Sessile plants constantly experience environmental stresses in nature. They must have evolved effective mechanisms to balance growth with stress response. Here we report the MADS-box transcription factor AGL16 acting as a negative regulator in stress response in Arabidopsis. Loss-of-AGL16 confers resistance to salt stress in seed germination, root elongation and soil-grown plants, while elevated AGL16 expression confers the opposite phenotypes compared with wild-type. However, the sensitivity to abscisic acid (ABA) in seed germination is inversely correlated with AGL16 expression levels. Transcriptomic comparison revealed that the improved salt resistance of agl16 mutants was largely attributed to enhanced expression of stress-responsive transcriptional factors and the genes involved in ABA signalling and ion homeostasis. We further demonstrated that AGL16 directly binds to the CArG motifs in the promoter of HKT1;1, HsfA6a and MYB102 and represses their expression. Genetic analyses with double mutants also support that HsfA6a and MYB102 are target genes of AGL16. Taken together, our results show that AGL16 acts as a negative regulator transcriptionally suppressing key components in the stress response and may play a role in balancing stress response with growth.

AB  - MADS-box genes encode transcription factors that are key regulators of plant inflorescence and flower development. We examined DNA sequence variation in 32 maize MADS-box genes and 32 randomly chosen maize loci and investigated their involvement in maize domestication and improvement. Using neutrality tests and a test based on coalescent simulation of a bottleneck model, we identified eight MADS-box genes as putative targets of the artificial selection associated with domestication. According to neutrality tests, one additional MADS-box gene appears to have been under selection during modern agricultural improvement of maize. For random loci, two genes were indicated as targets of selection during domestication and four additional genes were indicated to be candidate-selected loci for maize improvement. These results suggest that MADS-box genes were more frequent targets of selection during domestication than genes chosen at random from the genome.

AB  - Zea mays is an economically important crop, but its molecular mechanism of flowering remains largely uncharacterized. The gene, SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 (SOC1), integrates multiple flowering signals to regulate floral transition in Arabidopsis. In this study, ZmSOC1 was isolated from Zea mays. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the ZmSOC1 protein contained a highly conserved MADS domain and a typical SOC1 motif. ZmSOC1 protein was localized in the nucleus in protoplasts and showed no transcriptional activation activity in yeast cells. ZmSOC1 was highly expressed in maize reproductive organs, including filaments, ear and endosperm, but expression was very low in embryos; on the other hand, the abiotic stresses could repress ZmSOC1 expression. Overexpression of ZmSOC1 resulted in early flowering in Arabidopsis through increasing the expression of AtLFY and AtAP1. Overall, these results suggest that ZmSOC1 is a flowering promoter in Arabidopsis.

AB  - Conserved genomic context provides critical information for comparative evolutionary analysis. With the increase in numbers of sequenced plant genomes, synteny analysis can provide new insights into gene family evolution. Here, we exploit a network analysis approach to organize and interpret massive pairwise syntenic relationships. Specifically, we analyzed synteny networks of the MADS-box transcription factor gene family using 51 completed plant genomes. In combination with phylogenetic profiling, several novel evolutionary patterns were inferred and visualized from synteny network clusters. We found lineage-specific clusters that derive from transposition events for the regulators of floral development (APETALA3 and PI) and flowering time (FLC) in the Brassicales and for the regulators of root development (AGL17) in Poales. We also identified two large gene clusters that jointly encompass many key phenotypic regulatory Type II MADS-box gene clades (SEP1, SQUA, TM8, SEP3, FLC, AGL6, and TM3). Gene clustering and gene trees support the idea that these genes are derived from an ancient tandem gene duplication that likely predates the radiation of the seed plants and then expanded by subsequent polyploidy events. We also identified angiosperm-wide conservation of synteny of several other less studied clades. Combined, these findings provide new hypotheses for the genomic origins, biological conservation, and divergence of MADS-box gene family members.

AB  - Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as important regulators of gene expression and plant development. Here, we identified 6,510 lncRNAs in Arabidopsis under normal or stress conditions. We found that the expression of natural antisense transcripts (NATs) that are transcribed in the opposite direction of protein-coding genes often positively correlates with and is required for the expression of their cognate sense genes. We further characterized MAS, a NAT-lncRNA produced from the MADS AFFECTING FLOWERING4 (MAF4) locus. MAS is induced by cold and indispensable for the activation of MAF4 transcription and suppression of precocious flowering. MAS activates MAF4 by interacting with WDR5a, one core component of the COMPASS-like complexes, and recruiting WDR5a to MAF4 to enhance histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3). Our study greatly extends the repertoire of lncRNAs in Arabidopsis and reveals a role for NAT-lncRNAs in regulating gene expression in vernalization response and likely in other biological processes.

AB  - The large sunflower family, Asteraceae, is characterized by compressed, flower-like inflorescences that may bear phenotypically distinct flower types. The CYCLOIDEA (CYC)/TEOSINTE BRANCHED1-like transcription factors (TFs) belonging to the TEOSINTE BRANCHED1/CYCLOIDEA/PROLIFERATING CELL FACTOR (TCP) protein family are known to regulate bilateral symmetry in single flowers. In Asteraceae, they function at the inflorescence level, and were recruited to define differential flower type identities. Here, we identified upstream regulators of GhCYC3, a gene that specifies ray flower identity at the flower head margin in the model plant Gerbera hybrida We discovered a previously unidentified expression domain and functional role for the paralogous CINCINNATA-like TCP proteins. They function upstream of GhCYC3 and affect the developmental delay of marginal ray primordia during their early ontogeny. At the level of single flowers, the Asteraceae CYC genes show a unique function in regulating the elongation of showy ventral ligules that play a major role in pollinator attraction. We discovered that during ligule development, the E class MADS-box TF GRCD5 activates GhCYC3 expression. We propose that the C class MADS-box TF GAGA1 contributes to stamen development upstream of GhCYC3 Our data demonstrate how interactions among and between the conserved floral regulators, TCP and MADS-box TFs, contribute to the evolution of the elaborate inflorescence architecture of Asteraceae.

AB  - Metasequoia glyptostroboides is a famous redwood tree of ecological and economic importance, and requires more than 20 years of juvenile-to-adult transition before producing female and male cones. Previously, we induced reproductive buds using a hormone solution in juvenile Metasequoia trees as young as 5-to-7 years old. In the current study, hormone-treated shoots found in female and male buds were used to identify candidate genes involved in reproductive bud transition in Metasequoia. Samples from hormone-treated cone reproductive shoots and naturally occurring non-cone setting shoots were analyzed using 24 digital gene expression (DGE) tag profiles using Illumina, generating a total of 69,520 putative transcripts. Next, 32 differentially and specifically expressed transcripts were determined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, including the upregulation of MADS-box transcription factors involved in male bud transition and flowering time control proteins involved in female bud transition. These differentially expressed transcripts were associated with 243 KEGG pathways. Among the significantly changed pathways, sugar pathways were mediated by hormone signals during the vegetative-to-reproductive phase transition, including glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and sucrose and starch metabolism pathways. Key enzymes were identified in these pathways, including alcohol dehydrogenase (NAD) and glutathione dehydrogenase for the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway, and glucanphosphorylase for sucrose and starch metabolism pathways. Our results increase our understanding of the reproductive bud transition in gymnosperms. In addition, these studies on hormone-mediated sugar pathways increase our understanding of the relationship between sugar and hormone signaling during female and male bud initiation in Metasequoia.

AB  - MADS-box is a critical transcription factor regulating the development of floral organs and plays essential roles in the growth and development of floral transformation, flower meristem determination, the development of male and female gametophytes, and fruit development. In this study, 36 MIKC-type MADS-box genes were identified in the ‘Taishanhong’ pomegranate genome. By utilizing phylogenetic analysis, 36 genes were divided into 14 subfamilies. Bioinformatics methods were used to analyze the gene structure, conserved motifs, cis-acting elements, and the protein interaction networks of the MIKC-type MADS-box family members in pomegranate, and their expressions pattern in different tissues of pomegranate were analyzed. Tissue-specific expression analysis revealed that the E-class genes (PgMADS03, PgMADS21, and PgMADS27) were highly expressed in floral tissues, while PgMADS29 was not expressed in all tissues, indicating that the functions of the E-class genes were differentiated. PgMADS15 of the C/D-class was the key gene in the development network of pomegranate flower organs, suggesting that PgMADS15 might play an essential role in the peel and inner seed coat development of pomegranate. The results in this study will provide a reference for the classification, cloning, and functional research of pomegranate MADS-box genes.

AB  - Saururus chinensis is a core member of Saururaceae, an ancient, perianthless (lacking petals or sepals) family of the magnoliids in the Mesangiospermae, which is important for understanding the origin and evolution of early flowers due to its unusual floral composition and petaloid bracts. To compare their transcriptomes, RNA-seq abundance analysis identified 43,463 genes that were found to be differentially expressed in S. chinensis bracts. Of these, 5,797 showed significant differential expression, of which 1,770 were up-regulated and 4,027 down-regulated in green compared to white bracts. The expression profiles were also compared using cDNA microarrays, which identified 166 additional differentially expressed genes. Subsequently, qRT-PCR was used to verify and extend the cDNA microarray results, showing that the A and B class MADS-box genes were up-regulated in the white bracts. Phylogenetic analysis was performed on putative S. chinensis A and B-class of MADS-box genes to infer evolutionary relationships within the A and B-class of MADS-box gene family. In addition, nature selection and protein interactions of B class MADS-box proteins were inferred that B-class genes free from evolutionary pressures. The results indicate that petaloid bracts display anatomical and gene expression features normally associated with petals, as found in petaloid bracts of other species, and support an evolutionarily conserved developmental program for petaloid bracts.

AB  - Bud dormancy is crucial for winter survival and is characterized by the inability of the bud meristem to respond to growth-promotive signals before the chilling requirement (CR) is met. However, our understanding of the genetic mechanism regulating CR and bud dormancy remains limited. This study identified PpDAM6 (DORMANCY-ASSOCIATED MADS-box) as a key gene for CR using a genome-wide association study analysis based on structural variations in 345 peach (Prunus persica (L.) Batsch) accessions. The function of PpDAM6 in CR regulation was demonstrated by transiently silencing the gene in peach buds and stably overexpressing the gene in transgenic apple (Malus x domestica) plants. The results showed an evolutionarily conserved function of PpDAM6 in regulating bud dormancy release, followed by vegetative growth and flowering, in peach and apple. The 30-bp deletion in the PpDAM6 promoter was substantially associated with reducing PpDAM6 expression in low-CR accessions. A PCR marker based on the 30-bp indel was developed to distinguish peach plants with non-low and low CR. Modification of the H3K27me3 marker at the PpDAM6 locus showed no apparent change across the dormancy process in low- and non-low- CR cultivars. Additionally, H3K27me3 modification occurred earlier in low-CR cultivars on a genome-wide scale. PpDAM6 could mediate cell-cell communication by inducing the expression of the downstream genes PpNCED1 (9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase 1), encoding a key enzyme for ABA biosynthesis, and CALS (CALLOSE SYNTHASE), encoding callose synthase. We shed light on a gene regulatory network formed by PpDAM6-containing complexes that mediate CR underlying dormancy and bud break in peach. A better understanding of the genetic basis for natural variations of CR can help breeders develop cultivars with different CR for growing in different geographical regions.

AB  - The MADS box transcription factor Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) AGAMOUS-LIKE15 (AGL15) and a putative ortholog from soybean (Glycine max), GmAGL15, are able to promote somatic embryogenesis (SE) in these plants when ectopically expressed. SE is an important means of plant regeneration, but many plants, or even particular cultivars, are recalcitrant for this process. Understanding how (Gm)AGL15 promotes SE by identifying and characterizing direct and indirect downstream regulated genes can provide means to improve regeneration by SE for crop improvement and to perform molecular tests of genes. Conserved transcription factors and the genes they regulate in common between species may provide the most promising avenue to identify targets for SE improvement. We show that (Gm)AGL15 negatively regulates auxin signaling in both Arabidopsis and soybean at many levels of the pathway, including the repression of AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR6 (ARF6) and ARF8 and TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE1 as well as the indirect control of components via direct expression of a microRNA-encoding gene. We demonstrate interaction between auxin and gibberellic acid in the promotion of SE and document an inverse correlation between bioactive gibberellic acid and SE in soybean, a difficult crop to transform. Finally, we relate hormone accumulation to transcript accumulation of important soybean embryo regulatory factors such as ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE3 and FUSCA3 and provide a working model of hormone and transcription factor interaction in the control of SE.

AB  - In trees, stem secondary growth depends on vascular cambium proliferation activity and subsequent cell differentiation, in which an auxin concentration gradient across the cambium area plays a crucial role in regulating the process. However, the underlying molecular mechanism for the establishment of auxin concentration is not fully understood. In this study, we identified two function-unknown MADS-box genes, VCM1 and VCM2, which are expressed specifically in the vascular cambium and modulate the subcellular homeostasis of auxin. Simultaneous knockdown of both VCM1 and VCM2 enhanced vascular cambium proliferation activity and subsequent xylem differentiation. Overexpression of VCM1 suppressed vascular cambium activity and wood formation by regulating PIN5 expression, which tuned the soluble auxin concentration in the vascular cambium area. This study reveals the role of VCM1 and VCM2 in regulating the proliferation activity of the vascular cambium and secondary growth by modulating the subcellular auxin homeostasis in Populus.

AB  - MADS-box genes are critical regulators of growth and development in flowering plants. Sequencing of the Musa balbisiana (B) genome has provided a platform for the systematic analysis of the MADS-box gene family in the important banana ancestor Musa balbisiana. Seventy-seven MADS-box genes, including 18 type I and 59 type II, were strictly identified from the banana (Pisang Klutuk Wulung, PKW, 2n = 2x = 22) B genome. These genes have been preferentially placed on the banana B genome. Evolutionary analysis suggested that M. balbisiana MCM1-AGAMOUS-DEFICIENS-SRF (MbMADS) might be organized into the MIKC(c), MIKC*, Malpha, Mbeta, and Mgamma groups according to the phylogeny. MIKC(c) was then further categorized into 10 subfamilies according to conserved motif and gene structure analyses. The well-defined MADS-box genes highlight gene birth and death in banana. MbMADSes originated from the same ancestor as MaMADSes. Transcriptome analysis in cultivated banana (ABB) revealed that MbMADSes were conserved and differentially expressed in several organs, in various fruit developing and ripening stages, and in stress treatments, indicating the participation of these genes in fruit development, ripening, and stress responses. Of note, SEP/AGL2 and AG, as well as other several type II MADS-box genes, including the STMADS11 and TM3/SOC1 subfamilies, indicated elevated expression throughout banana fruit development, ripening, and stress treatments, indicating their new parts in controlling fruit development and ripening. According to the co-expression network analysis, MbMADS75 interacted with bZIP and seven other transcription factors to perform its function. This systematic analysis reveals fruit development, ripening, and stress candidate MbMADSes genes for additional functional studies in plants, improving our understanding of the transcriptional regulation of MbMADSes genes and providing a base for genetic modification of MADS-mediated fruit development, ripening, and stress.

AB  - Increasing rapeseed yield has always been a primary goal of rapeseed research and breeding. However, flowering time is a prerequisite for stable rapeseed yield and determines its adaptability to ecological regions. MIKC-type MADS-box (MICK) genes are a class of transcription factors that are involved in various physiological and developmental processes in plants. To understand their role in floral transition-related pathways, a genome-wide screening was conducted with Brassica napus (B. napus), which revealed 172 members. Using previous data from a genome-wide association analysis of flowering traits, BnaSVP and BnaSEP1 were identified as candidate flowering genes. Therefore, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to verify the function of BnaSVP and BnaSEP1 in B. napus. T0 plants were edited efficiently at the BnaSVP and BnaSEP1 target sites to generate homozygous and heterozygous mutants with most mutations stably inherited by the next generation. Notably, the mutant only showed the early flowering phenotype when all homologous copies of BnaSVP were edited, indicating functional redundancy between homologous copies. However, no changes in flowering were observed in the BnaSEP1 mutant. Quantitative analysis of the pathway-related genes in the BnaSVP mutant revealed the upregulation of SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 (SOC1) and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) genes, which promoted early flowering in the mutant. In summary, our study created early flowering mutants, which provided valuable resources for early maturing breeding, and provided a new method for improving polyploid crops.

AB  - Herbicides are the major tool for controlling large populations of yield depleting weeds. However, over-reliance on herbicides has resulted in weed adaptation and herbicide resistance. In recent years, early flowering weed species related to herbicide resistance is emerging, which may cause seed loss before crop harvest, creating a new problem for non-chemical weed management. In this study, a homologue gene of AGAMOUS sub-family (referred to as PfAG5) of the MADS-box family was cloned from plants of an early flowering Polypogon fugax Nees ex Steud. population resistant to the ACCase inhibitor herbicide (clodinafop-propargyl). The PfAG5 gene was functionally characterised in Arabidopsis thaliana L. Overexpression of the PfAG5 gene in Arabidopsis resulted in early flowering, abnormal flowers (e.g. small petals), short plants and reduced seed set, compared with the wild type. The expression of the PfAG5 gene was high in leaves and flowers, but low in pods in transgenic Arabidopsis. The PfAG5 gene was expressed earlier and higher in the resistant (R) than the susceptible (S) P. fugax plants. Furthermore, one protein (FRIGIDA-like) with relevance to flowering time regulation and interacts with PfAG5 in resistant (R) P. fugax was identified by the yeast two-hybrid and pull-down assays. These results suggest that the PfAG5 gene is involved in modulating early flowering in P. fugax.

AB  - The evolution of herbicide resistance in weedy plants leads to various adaptation traits including flowering time and seed germination. In our previous studies, we found an association of the early flowering phenotype with the ACCase inhibitor herbicide resistance genotype in a population of Polypogon fugax. MADS-box transcription factors are known to play pivotal roles in regulating plant flowering time. In this study, a SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP)-like gene, belonging to the StMADS11 subfamily in the MADS-box family, was cloned from the early flowering P. fugax population (referred to as PfMADS16) and resistant to the herbicide clodinafop- propargyl. Overexpression of the SVP-like gene PfMADS16 in Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in early flowering and seed abortion. This is consistent with the phenotypic characters of resistant P. fugax plants, but contrary to the conventional role of SVP-like genes that usually suppress flowering. In addition, down regulation of the seed formation gene AtKTN1 in flowers of PfMADS16 transgenic Arabidopsis plants indicates that PfMADS16 may be indirectly associated with seed viability. Furthermore, one protein (PfMADS2) from the APETALA1 (AP1) subfamily interacting with PfMADS16 in P. fugax was identified with relevance to flowering time regulation. These results suggest that the PfMADS16 gene is an early flowering regulation gene associated with seed formation and viability in resistant P. fugax population. Our study provides potential application of PfMADS16 for integrated weed management (such as genetic-based weed control strategies) aiming to reduce the soil weed seedbank.

AB  - MADS-box genes encode transcription factors that affect plant growth and development. Camellia chekiangoleosa is an oil tree species with ornamental value, but there have been few molecular biological studies on the developmental regulation of this species. To explore their possible role in C. chekiangoleosa and lay a foundation for subsequent research, 89 MADS-box genes were identified across the whole genome of C. chekiangoleosa for the first time. These genes were present on all the chromosomes and were found to have expanded by tandem duplication and fragment duplication. Based on the results of a phylogenetic analysis, the 89 MADS-box genes could be divided into either type I (38) or type II (51). Both the number and proportion of the type II genes were significantly greater than those of Camellia sinensis and Arabidopsis thaliana, indicating that C. chekiangoleosa type II genes experienced a higher duplication rate or a lower loss rate. The results of both a sequence alignment and a conserved motif analysis suggest that the type II genes are more conserved, meaning that they may have originated and differentiated earlier than the type I genes did. At the same time, the presence of extra-long amino acid sequences may be an important feature of C. chekiangoleosa. Gene structure analysis revealed the number of introns of MADS-box genes: twenty-one type I genes had no introns, and 13 type I genes contained only 1~2 introns. The type II genes have far more introns and longer introns than the type I genes do. Some MIKC(C) genes have super large introns (>/=15 kb), which are rare in other species. The super large introns of these MIKC(C) genes may indicate richer gene expression. Moreover, the results of a qPCR expression analysis of the roots, flowers, leaves and seeds of C. chekiangoleosa showed that the MADS-box genes were expressed in all those tissues. Overall, compared with that of the type I genes, the expression of the type II genes was significantly higher. The CchMADS31 and CchMADS58 genes (type II) were highly expressed specifically in the flowers, which may in turn regulate the size of the flower meristem and petals. CchMADS55 was expressed specifically in the seeds, which might affect seed development. This study provides additional information for the functional characterization of the MADS-box gene family and lays an important foundation for in-depth study of related genes, such as those involved in the development of the reproductive organs of C. chekiangoleosa.

These transcription factors are involved in processes such as the formation of the flower organ structure and the seed development of plants. Ginkgo biloba has two genome versions (version 2019 and version 2021), and there is no analysis or comparison of the MADS-box gene family in these two genomes. In this study, 26 and 20 MADS-box genes were identified from the two genomes of Ginkgo, of which 12 pairs of genes reached more than 80% similarity. According to our phylogenetic analysis results, we divided these genes into type I (Malpha and Mgamma subfamilies) and type II (MIKC and Mdelta subfamilies) members. We found that both sets of genomes lacked the Mbeta gene, while the MIKC gene was the most numerous. Further analysis of the gene structure showed that the MIKC genes in the two genomes had extralong introns (>/=20 kb); these introns had different splicing patterns, and their expression might be more abundant. The gene expression analysis proved that GbMADS genes were expressed to varying degrees in eight Ginkgo biological tissues. Type II GbMADS genes not only were found to be related to female flower bud differentiation and development but also are important in seed development. Therefore, MADS-box genes may play important roles in the development of Ginkgo reproductive organs, which may suggest a genetic role in sexual differentiation. This study further contributes to the research on MADS-box genes and provides new insights into sex determination in Ginkgo.

AB  - Appressorium formation is a key step in the infection cycle of Magnaporthe oryzae. Mst12 is a transcription factor essential for appressorium penetration and invasive growth. In this study we used the affinity purification approach to identify proteins that physically associate with Mst12. One of the Mst12-interacting genes identified was MoMCM1, which encodes a MADS-box protein orthologous to yeast Mcm1. MoMcm1 interacted with both Mst12 and Mata-1 in yeast two-hybrid assays. Deletion of MoMCM1 resulted in the loss of male fertility and microconidium production. The Momcm1 mutant was defective in appressorium penetration and formed narrower invasive hyphae, which may be responsible for its reduced virulence. In transformants expressing MoMCM1-eGFP fusion, GFP signals were observed in the nucleus. We also generated the Momcm1 mst12 double mutant, which was defective in penetration and non-pathogenic. On hydrophilic surfaces, germ tubes produced by the double mutant were severely curved, and 20% of them formed appressoria. In contrast, the Momcm1 or mst12 mutant did not form appressoria on hydrophilic surfaces. These results suggest that MoMCM1 and MST12 have overlapping functions to suppress appressorium formation under non-conducive conditions. MoMcm1 may interact with Mst12 and MatA-1 to regulate germ tube identity and male fertility respectively.

AB  - The MADS-box family genes are important transcription factors that play essential roles in plant growth and development. In this study, a MADS-box gene, CsMADS02, was identified and functionally characterized in cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.). CsMADS02 encoded a typical SEP MADS-box protein which contained a MADS-box, a K-box, an I region and a C region, as well as two short conserved SEP motifs. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis showed that the CsMADS02 protein belonged to the SEP3 subfamily and was highly homologous to other published plant SEP proteins. Expression analyses revealed that CsMADS02 was primarily expressed in flowers and ovaries, and differentially expressed during the development of male and female flowers. Ectopic overexpression of CsMADS02 caused earlier flowering of Arabidopsis. In addition, morphological changes were also observed in transgenic plants, including curled and fewer rosette leaves. These findings suggest that CsMADS02 is a potential regulator of the flowering time and leaf morphology in cucumber.

AB  - AGL15 is an Arabidopsis thaliana MADS-domain regulatory factor that not only preferentially accumulates during embryogenesis but is also expressed at lower levels after the completion of germination. To better understand the control of expression of AGL15, a series of 5' and internal deletions within the regulatory regions of AGL15 was generated. Regions important for the level of expression, including a region involved in expression in response to auxin, were identified. Additionally, AGL15 expression was found to respond to AGL15 accumulation amounts and to altered forms of AGL15. This feedback loop is at least in part due to direct regulation, as assessed by in vivo and in vitro binding of AGL15 to its own regulatory regions and by site-directed mutagenesis studies.

AB  - MADS-box transcription factors (TFs) participate in various biological processes, including stress response, plant growth and development. The storage root of sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas) is an important staple food crop in Asian and African areas, and leafy sweetpotato is a popular and healthy vegetable in China. However, the function of the MADS genes remains largely unknown in sweetpotato and the other Ipomoea species. In this study, we carried out a genome-wide gene family analysis of MADS in Ipomoea trifida which is currently considered as the most potential ancestor of sweetpotato. A total of 37 ItfMADS genes that encode 42 proteins were identified. The evolutionary relationship was analysed for MADS proteins in 37 species. According to the tree topology of phylogeny, the ItfMADS genes are classified into Mα, Mβ, Mγ, MIKCC and MIKC* groups. Gene structure analysis revealed that the majority of ItfMADS in the same clade displayed similar exon–intron distribution. Furthermore, the expression patterns of ItfMADS genes were investigated through RNA-seq data and confirmed by qRT-PCR. The expression of ItfMADS genes varied among different tissues, and induced or repressed under different abiotic stresses, thereby suggesting their potential functions under abiotic stresses. Our findings lay a solid foundation for further elucidating the ItfMADS function and promoting sweetpotato molecular breeding.

AB  - The spatiotemporal control of meristem identity is critical for determining inflorescence architecture, and thus yield, of cereal plants. However, the precise mechanisms underlying inflorescence and spikelet meristem determinacy in cereals are still largely unclear. We have generated loss-of-function and overexpression mutants of the paralogous OsMADS5 and OsMADS34 genes in rice (Oryza sativa), and analysed their panicle phenotypes. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, electrophoretic mobility-shift and dual-luciferase assays, we have also identified RICE CENTRORADIALIS 4 (RCN4), a TFL1-like gene, as a direct downstream target of both OsMADS proteins, and have analysed RCN4 mutants. The osmads5 osmads34 mutant lines had significantly enhanced panicle branching with increased secondary, and even tertiary and quaternary, branches, compared to wild-type (WT) and osmads34 plants. The osmads34 mutant phenotype could largely be rescued by also knocking out RCN4. Moreover, transgenic panicles overexpressing RCN4 had significantly increased branching, and initiated development of c. 7x more spikelets than WT. Our results reveal a role for OsMADS5 in panicle development, and show that OsMADS5 and OsMADS34 play similar functions in limiting branching and promoting the transition to spikelet meristem identity, in part by repressing RCN4 expression. These findings provide new insights to better understand the molecular regulation of rice inflorescence architecture.

AB  - Land plants (embryophytes) are characterized by an alternation of two generations, the haploid gametophyte and the diploid sporophyte. The development of the small and simple male gametophyte of the flowering plant Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) critically depends on the action of five MIKC* group MCM1-AGAMOUS-DEFICIENS-SRF-box (MADS-box) proteins. In this study, these MIKC* MADS-box genes were isolated from land plants with relatively large and complex gametophyte bodies, namely the bryophytes. We found that although the gene family expanded in the mosses Sphagnum subsecundum, Physcomitrella patens, and Funaria hygrometrica, only a single homologue, Marchantia polymorpha MADS-box gene 1 (MpMADS1), has been retained in the liverwort M. polymorpha. Liverworts are the earliest diverging land plants, and so a comparison of MpMADS1 with its angiosperm homologues addresses the molecular evolution of an embryophyte-specific transcription factor over the widest phylogenetic distance. MpMADS1 was found to form a homodimeric DNA-binding complex, which is in contrast to the Arabidopsis proteins that are functional only as heterodimeric complexes. The M. polymorpha homodimer, nevertheless, recognizes the same DNA sequences as its angiosperm counterparts and can functionally replace endogenous MIKC* complexes to a significant extent when heterologously expressed in Arabidopsis pollen. The 11 MIKC* homologues from the moss F. hygrometrica are highly and almost exclusively expressed in the gametophytic generation. Taken together, these findings suggest that MIKC* MADS-box proteins have largely preserved molecular roles in the gametophytic generation of land plants.

AB  - Evolutionarily conserved DEK domain-containing proteins have been implicated in multiple chromatin-related processes, mRNA splicing and transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes. Here, we show that two DEK proteins, DEK3 and DEK4, control the floral transition in Arabidopsis. DEK3 and DEK4 directly associate with chromatin of related flowering repressors, FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), and its two homologs, MADS AFFECTING FLOWERING4 (MAF4) and MAF5, to promote their expression. The binding of DEK3 and DEK4 to a histone octamer in vivo affects histone modifications at FLC, MAF4 and MAF5 loci. In addition, DEK3 and DEK4 interact with RNA polymerase II and promote the association of RNA polymerase II with FLC, MAF4 and MAF5 chromatin to promote their expression. Our results show that DEK3 and DEK4 directly interact with chromatin to facilitate the transcription of key flowering repressors and thus prevent precocious flowering in Arabidopsis.

AB  - Passiflora is a plant genus known for its extremely distinctive and colorful flowers and a wide range of genome size variation. However, how genome characteristics are related to flower traits among Passiflora species remains poorly understood. Here, we assembled a chromosome-scale genome of P. foetida, which belongs to the same subgenus as the commercial passionfruit P. edulis. The genome of P. foetida is smaller (424.16 Mb) and contains fewer copies of long terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTR-RTs). The disparity in LTR-RTs is one of the main contributors to the differences in genome sizes between these two species and possibly in floral traits. Additionally, we observed variation in insertion times and copy numbers of LTR-RTs across different transposable element (TE) lineages. Then, by integrating transcriptomic data from 33 samples (eight floral organs and flower buds at three developmental stages) with phylogenomic and metabolomic data, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the expression, phylogeny, and copy number of MIKC-type MADS-box genes and identified essential biosynthetic genes responsible for flower color and scent from glandular bracts and other floral organs. Our study pinpoints LRT-RTs as an important player in genome size variation in Passiflora species and provides insights into future genetic improvement.

AB  - Grain weight and size are important traits determining grain yield and influencing grain quality in rice. In a previous study, a quantitative trait locus controlling thousand-grain weight (TGW) in rice, qTGW10-20.8, was mapped in a 70.7 kb region on chromosome 10. Validation of the candidate gene for qTGW10-20.8, OsMADS56 encoding a MADS-box transcription factor, was performed in this study. In a near-isogenic line (NIL) population segregated only at the OsMADS56 locus, NILs carrying the OsMADS56 allele of IRBB52 were 1.9% and 2.9% lower in TGW than NILs carrying the OsMADS56 allele of Teqing in 2018 and 2020, respectively. Using OsMADS56 knock-out mutants and overexpression transgenic plants, OsMADS56 was validated as the causal gene for qTGW10-20.8. Compared with the recipients, the TGW of the knock-out mutants was reduced by 6.0-15.0%. In these populations, decreased grain weight and size were associated with a reduction in the expression of OsMADS56. In transgenic populations of OsMADS56 driven by a strong constitutive promoter, grain weight and size of the positive plants were significantly higher than those of the negative plants. Haplotype analysis showed that the Teqing-type allele of OsMADS56 is the major type presented in cultivated rice and used in variety improvement. Cloning of OsMADS56 provides a new gene resource to improve grain weight and size through molecular design breeding.
